[15/01/2020, 03:57:52] Richard: Gentelmen, got back home trying to settle but following up to my discussion with somw of you. We should start coming up with ideas of the Lumbe, anyone who has sample budgets to share and any service providers we can engage.
[15/01/2020, 03:58:28] Richard: 6 months left. So considering that we have to also make personal travel arrangements let’s try and finish the Lumbe needs so you can all focus or urself and family
[15/01/2020, 03:58:41] Richard: Let’s have a quick meeting when time allows

[15/01/2020, 19:26:54] kaksmat US: Jingo could look up a budget or ask dad
[15/01/2020, 19:27:23] kaksmat US: Just wondering whether people will fit in Busega
[15/01/2020, 19:27:55] Richard: Angelo and Joseph and I had talked about that too
[15/01/2020, 19:28:04] Richard: If he has let us renovate we would
[15/01/2020, 19:28:18] Richard: I am thinking of breaking the toilet in the back,
[15/01/2020, 19:28:34] Richard: Build a new one at the lower end of the garden and clearing that whole place
[15/01/2020, 19:28:44] Richard: And may be Concrete or something
[15/01/2020, 19:28:52] Richard: They should fit then
[15/01/2020, 19:29:04] Richard: Dad didn’t want to touch the front
[15/01/2020, 19:29:29] Richard: And I honestly can’t argue with him much
[15/01/2020, 19:29:58] kaksmat US: My worry is that water from the tap, has to be channeled
[15/01/2020, 19:40:52] Richard: That’s a good point
[15/01/2020, 19:40:57] Richard: I just called him actually
[15/01/2020, 19:41:14] Richard: He seems fine as long as he is in control 😄
[15/01/2020, 19:41:42] Richard: So he says he will find someone who will advise him and then he will
Tell is
[15/01/2020, 19:43:01] kaksmat US: ok
[15/01/2020, 20:20:55] Richard: He has no idea about Budgets
[15/01/2020, 20:21:03] Richard: I can get one from Kawalya’s dad
[15/01/2020, 20:21:10] Richard: They just did a Lumbe
[15/01/2020, 20:21:50] kaksmat US: Ok
[15/01/2020, 20:22:36] kaksmat US: I hope our emphasis will be on memorial service on Saturday
[15/01/2020, 20:23:27] kaksmat US: People do funny things at lumbe, i think we have to be careful
[15/01/2020, 20:38:15] Richard: Man
[15/01/2020, 20:38:37] Richard: I was talking to my other two brothers and told them we have to take charge this time
[15/01/2020, 20:39:15] Richard: Some people comouhplage as though there to help but we have to be extremely strict on who is helping with what
[15/01/2020, 20:39:23] Richard: We can control the nonsense
[15/01/2020, 20:39:36] Richard: Especially also since our kids will be there
[15/01/2020, 20:39:51] Richard: Some people are waiting for that one opportunity
[15/01/2020, 20:44:21] kaksmat US: Ya
[15/01/2020, 20:45:15] kaksmat US: They do witchy things in the night, and even when announcing the heir.
[15/01/2020, 20:55:30] Richard: See how non of us is not having night mares or wierd messages from Mom— she is resting in Peace!! I have heard that some people of stuff to awaken/de-settle her spirit
[15/01/2020, 20:55:46] Richard: I don’t know how true but it would be nice for her to rest

[15/01/2020, 20:59:45] Kabum: We pray so
[15/01/2020, 20:59:55] Tiano: it just hurts thats dad would prefer advise from someone else's advise before he does what his sons tell him
[15/01/2020, 20:59:56] Richard: We have to be alert still Mathew has a point
[15/01/2020, 21:00:08] Tiano: ofcourse

[15/01/2020, 21:00:44] Tiano: I do all the time
[15/01/2020, 21:00:50] Richard: He is so focused on rescuing his house in Buloba
[15/01/2020, 21:01:09] Richard: Today when I called he spent about 10’minutes discussing that
[15/01/2020, 21:01:18] Richard: When I brought up the Lumbe he went silent
[15/01/2020, 21:02:05] Richard: Everything now days revolves around Annet

[22/01/2020, 17:41:47] Richard: I don’t like him that much but I don’t know any local builders
[22/01/2020, 17:42:10] Richard: Mathew do you know anyone?
[22/01/2020, 17:45:02] kaksmat US: There is a guy i gave him who built the toilet at his house in Buloba
[22/01/2020, 17:45:15] kaksmat US: I remember he said he was expensive
[22/01/2020, 17:45:44] Richard: Today I told him Bakube was expensive and he said being expensive  doesn’t matter
[22/01/2020, 17:46:02] Richard: I told him if we are paying that’s the main thing
[22/01/2020, 17:47:07] Richard: We will have both look at what needs to be done and whoever has a better price is the one we will go with
[22/01/2020, 17:49:50] kaksmat US: Ya, also have other guys in Buloba, like the one who built my demolished house
[22/01/2020, 17:51:35] Richard: It may make sense to use a guy like that than engaging Bakube
[22/01/2020, 17:51:58] Richard: The fact that he saw us growing up makes negotiating with him hard
[22/01/2020, 17:55:23] kaksmat US: I agree
[22/01/2020, 17:55:41] Tiano: i second
[22/01/2020, 18:00:59] Richard: So I will call him and tell him we have already agreed with someone else bla bla
[22/01/2020, 18:01:17] Richard: Then let’s talk to your guy in Buloba and have him start by giving us a quote
[22/01/2020, 18:07:31] kaksmat US: Kaale, but the builder is different from the digger though i have both
[22/01/2020, 18:08:28] kaksmat US: The digger will probably be cheaper, i think he does about 7000 but feet
[22/01/2020, 18:17:07] Richard: I paid for the digging before mom passed
[22/01/2020, 18:17:19] Richard: Even the slab is built
[22/01/2020, 18:17:28] kaksmat US: Oh ok, i see
[22/01/2020, 18:17:42] Richard: It’s just building the kayumba and binabiro
[22/01/2020, 18:18:04] Richard: Clearing the old one and the chicken house and making the lugya functional
[22/01/2020, 18:18:21] kaksmat US: Ok
[22/01/2020, 18:18:23] Richard: We can decide if we want to put concrete
[22/01/2020, 18:18:36] Richard: Possibly repair the old one
[22/01/2020, 18:19:10] Richard: At least in the area where they will be cooking from

[23/01/2020, 17:25:51] Richard: I have a guy doing some work for me, he will be done in about two weeks, I will engage him
[23/01/2020, 17:26:20] Richard: I got him from Stella sometime back but he is a legitimate consistent and honest guy
[23/01/2020, 17:26:24] Richard: So far
[23/01/2020, 17:27:02] kaksmat US: kaale
[23/01/2020, 18:48:45] Kabum: We might need to raise the perimeter fence a little higher too esp at the lower end. Last time I was there you could see over it while standing inside
[23/01/2020, 21:23:57] Richard: I think for now let’s focus on the space for the lumbe

[01/02/2020, 04:30:07] kaksmat US: I'm a rugby player, werabidde
[01/02/2020, 04:31:09] Angelo(us): Heheh
[01/02/2020, 15:55:20] Richard: Hi Guys! I know we haven’t all talked recently. But I wanted to table that Mom’s lumbe is off the table for now. We all seem to have some factors in play that make it abit hard to celebrate her life together. I specifically want to wait for Alyvia to be able to join us as Mathew sorts through some stuff as well. We offcoarse don’t want any information outside the 5 of us until we have confirmed that’s what all of us agree to doing. Let’s spend next week thinking and deliberating over this and then we can communicate it after. I plan to be in Uganda in the summer either way as I had already finalized some plans. I am ok to make two trips if necessary but let’s think some more on when we feel we will all be ready to pull the trigger. 
I insist on 5 of us for starters as far as this discussion . Not Dad or anyone’ else for now
[01/02/2020, 18:57:10] kaksmat US: In general, i think we need to hear from Francis and Joseph,  what do you guys think. The 3 of us had agreed to postpone
[01/02/2020, 19:12:53] Tiano: Ofcourse it has to be the 5 of us or nothing. If even just 1 of us cant make it, then we shouldnt proceed to have it. This lady gave birth to 5, so it takes the 5 of us to celebrate her. Her blood runs in us and our unity celebrates her life, nothing else.
[02/02/2020, 00:43:50] Kabum: I was all in for July this year and had put everything else on halt. But of course would be fine with everything that favours everyone of us. Not sure when you guys think we can have it but truth is i can’t have a clear picture of what will be prevailing then
[02/02/2020, 00:47:27] Kabum: I’ll however still have to make that July trip too
[03/02/2020, 18:33:10] Tiano: Nakayiza thanks you all for the contributions you sent through, mwebale 👏👏

[05/02/2020, 18:55:47] kaksmat US: Yasomye ki mpozzi
[05/02/2020, 19:32:57] Richard: Business Admin and Management
[05/02/2020, 19:33:02] Richard: He hasn’t graduated yet
[05/02/2020, 19:33:14] Richard: But I have been helping him here and there
[05/02/2020, 19:33:31] Richard: He is smart and devoted (serious)
[05/02/2020, 21:26:46] kaksmat US: Ali Uganda?
[05/02/2020, 21:45:39] Richard: Yes, he is in Nkozi
[05/02/2020, 22:08:17] kaksmat US: Kaale
[06/02/2020, 10:31:00] Richard: Banange let’s talk this weekend if you can looks like we have to do the Lumbe - we have half  a year to get ready. I will do everything I can on the financial side. I hadn’t considering Ugandan Elections- Nominations are in August and I foresee chaos after that until 2021. Everyone anticipates chaos and I don’t want our families to be caught up in that drama. So tentatively since Mathew can’t leave it too close to the end of July let’s shoot for July 17th.
[06/02/2020, 10:39:28] Richard: Let’s do things when we have to do them and culturally let mom Rest In Peace. I think which ever way we have to do it. On a high level let’s plan 500$ each towards the lumbe. And then each worry about our logistics. I will take care of whatever balances. Let me get a budget together and share with you guys— but let’s continue discussing but that’s where my thoughts are today
[06/02/2020, 10:51:58] Tiano: okay

[10/02/2020, 19:14:43] Richard: Once I get back from Vacation I am going to engage Bakube and see if his numbers make more sense
[10/02/2020, 19:40:40] Kabum: Let me get right, This is only the toilet??
[10/02/2020, 19:50:38] Richard: Yeap
[10/02/2020, 19:50:52] Richard: I also couldn’t believe him.
[10/02/2020, 19:52:39] Kabum: Is the plan of clearing the lusuku is still on?
[10/02/2020, 19:52:48] Richard: Not entirely
[10/02/2020, 19:53:18] Richard: I am not getting any resistance from dad but I also haven’t talked to him for abit. I plan on giving him a call once I return home
[10/02/2020, 19:54:17] Kabum: Okay.
[12/02/2020, 18:42:59] Richard: Emma the builder mom used to use went home and talked to Dad. He wants the job and he is local
[12/02/2020, 18:43:12] Richard: I have called him and asked him to give me an estimate
[12/02/2020, 20:01:04] kaksmat US: Kaale
[12/02/2020, 20:27:49] Tiano: he talked to me too

[12/02/2020, 21:10:47] Richard: Hehe
[12/02/2020, 21:10:54] Richard: Kale tukusonyiye
[12/02/2020, 21:11:30] Richard: But on a serious note— what are your thoughts since ur on ground?
[12/02/2020, 21:19:48] Tiano: this Emma guy is much cheaper than the other guy
[12/02/2020, 21:19:53] Tiano: much cheaper
[12/02/2020, 21:20:33] Tiano: so i guess we should go with
him, he mentioned that he can start on Monday next week actually
[12/02/2020, 21:30:26] Richard: Ok
[12/02/2020, 21:32:57] Richard: Let him get some numbers together to we know how much materials we need
[12/02/2020, 21:33:01] Richard: Etc
[12/02/2020, 21:59:07] Kabum: I knew Emma only as an Electrician and not a builder. I hope he’ll do an excellent job
[12/02/2020, 22:07:51] kaksmat US: For me I know Emma as a cook
[12/02/2020, 22:08:26] Tiano: its not the Emma you know that we are talking about
[12/02/2020, 22:14:15] Richard: Heheh
[12/02/2020, 22:14:27] Kabum: Okay
[13/02/2020, 02:46:19] Angelo(us): For me now I know Emma all three above. Thanks to you all
[13/02/2020, 02:47:42] kaksmat US: Shaa, even the driver
[13/02/2020, 03:54:58] Richard: By the way when I talked to dad today he was sick. He has just gotten some injections
[13/02/2020, 03:55:02] Richard: He is positive
[13/02/2020, 05:57:42] kaksmat US: Nga alabye
[15/02/2020, 15:30:51] Richard: Jimgoman let me know when you speak to the builder

[15/02/2020, 19:43:09] Kabum: Hehehe
[15/02/2020, 19:47:49] Richard: What happened after?
[15/02/2020, 19:48:36] Angelo(us): Mida nagikonya
[15/02/2020, 19:48:57] kaksmat US: That's Lydia's secret. Why do think tanoba
[15/02/2020, 19:50:32] Richard: Hehe
[16/02/2020, 16:42:43] Tiano: hey
[16/02/2020, 16:42:56] Tiano: we want to start building the latrine
[16/02/2020, 16:43:47] Tiano: talked to Emma and says we can send buy some starting material then he can start
[16/02/2020, 16:44:13] Tiano: 300k, a lorry of bricks
130k, a lorry of sand
100k, cement
100k, labour for the start
[16/02/2020, 18:10:53] Richard: I will send the 630’ today
[16/02/2020, 18:11:15] Richard: You guys can pick up the next item
[17/02/2020, 13:21:46] Tiano: Richard sent money and the builder started today,   he was saying that we sent less, but that was my doing, he wants labour of 200k every week, but i refused. thats why I told you 100k labour in the break down.
[17/02/2020, 13:25:18] Richard: Paying weekly is tricky if he is slow
[17/02/2020, 13:25:54] Richard: We need to sum up the cost of the job and take it from there. At least the phases and how much they will cost
[17/02/2020, 13:28:31] Tiano: I might be going home tomorrow, so I will discuss with him and revert. We will discuss the length and the cost of labour
[17/02/2020, 13:36:25] Richard: Ok
[17/02/2020, 16:42:20] Richard: I need final confirmation from everyone that 7/17/20 is the day for the Lumbe. And then we can inform
Paps etc
[17/02/2020, 16:43:19] Kabum: I’m good with 17/7
[17/02/2020, 16:47:11] Angelo(us): I guess it can be. I dont see any reason for Objection
[17/02/2020, 16:49:40] Richard: Is that a confirmation sir?
[17/02/2020, 16:51:09] Angelo(us): Yes
[17/02/2020, 16:51:41] Richard: Thank you.
[17/02/2020, 16:51:54] Richard: I will call dad once I hear from Mathew and Jingo

[17/02/2020, 18:09:37] Richard: Ok
[17/02/2020, 18:17:24] Richard: Talked to Dad, and told him he should think of something to contribute too.
[17/02/2020, 18:17:35] Richard: And he said Ofcoarse I know that I have to contribute
[17/02/2020, 18:18:27] Richard: he said people have been asking him but when I tried to dig what he meant and which people he answered vaguely
[17/02/2020, 18:19:00] Richard: He also said the material for the toilet has been brought

‎[18/02/2020, 00:12:37] Angelo(us): ‎image omitted
[19/02/2020, 15:18:01] Tiano: Hey guys
[19/02/2020, 15:18:27] Tiano: building commenced meanwhile, we decided to use Emma
[19/02/2020, 15:19:12] Tiano: so i have talked to Emma, he says we might need to buy a wheel barrow because of how much work we have to do, he was planning to be hiring but thats not worth it given that the price for hiring is 4k per day, a new wheel barrow costs 130k, also he says we need a spade, costs 20k. and that the cement is running out, we need to reload for tomorrow's work.
[19/02/2020, 15:47:20] Tiano: not sure if any of you wish to support the cause
[19/02/2020, 15:48:02] kaksmat US: Mwebale. Abit tight on my side now but let me see at the end of the month
[19/02/2020, 16:01:59] Richard: So we need wheelbarrow and Cement?
[19/02/2020, 16:02:20] Richard: Have some calls this morning but let me finalize and see what I can do
[19/02/2020, 16:04:25] Tiano: yes please.
[19/02/2020, 17:44:02] Kabum: Just seen these..
[19/02/2020, 17:44:14] Kabum: was someone able to come through??
[19/02/2020, 17:47:46] Richard: Not yet,  let me know if you can come through. Looks like we will just send what we can so that Jingo manages the process as it progresses
[19/02/2020, 17:54:27] Kabum: I can pick this one up
[19/02/2020, 17:54:54] Richard: Thank you!
[19/02/2020, 17:57:07] Tiano: thank you Jose
[19/02/2020, 18:00:55] Tiano: 250k, 130k for wheel barrow, 20k for spade, 100k for cement
[19/02/2020, 18:04:26] Tiano: but ofcourse we  are still building, its good to chip in once in a while.
[19/02/2020, 18:05:05] Richard: Did the guy complain about labour?
[19/02/2020, 18:05:20] Richard: Rather clarify on how much it will end up being
[19/02/2020, 18:07:22] Tiano: so we will take what you can even though its more than this
[19/02/2020, 18:09:18] Kabum: I can give the 250 for now.
[19/02/2020, 18:09:33] Kabum: What was agreed on about the labour??
[19/02/2020, 18:10:30] Richard: I will pay him. I think he needs some more money than I sent him
[19/02/2020, 18:11:01] Kabum: I also think we need someone to supervise the progress and monitor how cement runs and stuff. Hope dad can help with that
[19/02/2020, 18:12:59] Kabum: Great, but i think he needs to mention a total fee for labour that will get the job done, so we don’t hv any issues with him in the future
[19/02/2020, 18:16:30] Richard: That’s up to Jingo
[19/02/2020, 18:23:29] Richard: But we will manage slowly
[20/02/2020, 18:38:16] Richard: Martin called me to discuss something else and I told him we finalized the date to be 7/17/20
[20/02/2020, 18:38:50] Richard: And he doesn’t sound happy but I told him there were so many factors to consider that’s the best date that worked for all of us
[20/02/2020, 18:39:01] Richard: So they will have to adjust their plans accordingly
[20/02/2020, 18:39:24] Richard: Just letting you know
[20/02/2020, 18:39:47] Richard: Last night I paid for our tickets returning on the 26th of July

[20/02/2020, 18:41:09] Richard: Set me back almost  $10k
[20/02/2020, 18:41:24] Richard: We are not changing the date
[20/02/2020, 18:43:23] kaksmat US: Why wouldnt he, did they buy the ticket already
[20/02/2020, 18:44:07] Richard: I don’t think so.. I had to take him off the call before I got pissed
[20/02/2020, 18:44:41] Richard: He told me they had all set their programs to be around the 24th bla bla
[20/02/2020, 18:45:32] Richard: I am not suprised but like I said before we can’t make plans based on other people. He expressed doubt and we made plans based on what works for us
[20/02/2020, 18:46:29] Richard: I will call him back at lunch
[20/02/2020, 18:46:54] kaksmat US: Well, it's good you have told them, they can adjust early
[20/02/2020, 19:05:29] Tiano: Talked to the builder, they are running out of sand, as well as the bricks, then he needs some money for wood for the stair cases
[20/02/2020, 19:36:29] Richard: Andrew called me too— it’s funny how people can raise dust over
[20/02/2020, 19:39:51] Richard: Andrew says that I should speak to Angelo or Mathew to deal with them. Based on my history with them they will make this about me
[20/02/2020, 19:54:42] Richard: We will take care of them. Call me when you get a chance
[20/02/2020, 20:28:21] Richard: Dad says not to worry about them. If that’s the date we can manage we should work with that.
[21/02/2020, 02:45:03] kaksmat US: Thinking through the events of today makes me realize that we  might see a lot more of the like in the future, especially concerning this matter. I just wanna say we should stay focused and not to mind the ridiculous behavior of some people around us
[21/02/2020, 02:57:05] Richard: Joseph called me and I am just in awe, Resty says to him that everyone bought their tickets including her freinds and so many other things. How did the conversation from three weeks ago or so saying they may not be there turn into some blame game.  It’s so easy for people to turn one person into a fool. I feel a little bit disrespected and some type of over reach. We don’t need to explain why we move , cancel or even decide what date to use. It’s absurd that people just wait for a moment to pounce on something and make it the issue. You are right. We are too busy as it is dealing with all the stuff in ours lives it’s important not to be dragged into the dirt
[21/02/2020, 03:21:53] kaksmat US: Ya, God will help us through this
[21/02/2020, 03:26:11] Richard: Amen.  I don’t have any energy to fight people anymore. That phase of my life passed.
[21/02/2020, 16:39:50] kaksmat US: It’s in Ssisa 10 miles from total kajjansi a plot is 17m
[21/02/2020, 16:39:50] kaksmat US: They are 6 plots
[21/02/2020, 16:39:50] kaksmat US: Title in my names land was acquired from Canaan sites lake view estates
[21/02/2020, 16:40:17] kaksmat US: From Maria my friend, in any of you is interested
[21/02/2020, 16:42:22] Richard: She told me about this one last year. I was trying to help her
[21/02/2020, 16:42:36] kaksmat US: i see
[21/02/2020, 17:07:09] Richard: Will be in Houston Texas next week by the way. Wednesday to Wednesday

[21/02/2020, 17:08:46] Kabum: Man on the road always
[21/02/2020, 17:08:57] Richard: Almost slowing down
[21/02/2020, 17:09:10] kaksmat US: safe travels
[21/02/2020, 17:09:25] Kabum: Nice journey
[21/02/2020, 17:09:47] kaksmat US: ya
[21/02/2020, 17:10:39] Richard: I think you can get an acre in that area for the price of two plots. I will send you a local brokers number
[21/02/2020, 17:11:19] Richard: 0759-755075 - Ibra
[21/02/2020, 17:14:22] Kabum: Okay
[21/02/2020, 17:15:26] Kabum: Hehe..money for the acre isn’t available, not even for the plot is, as yet.
[21/02/2020, 17:40:22] Richard: Mpola mpola.

[22/02/2020, 08:02:22] Richard: I will send some money
[22/02/2020, 08:02:28] Richard: Please tell me how much

[23/02/2020, 18:14:49] Kabum: What’s the plan??
[23/02/2020, 18:16:14] Richard: Jingo had an experience with dad. There may be people trying to convince him to sell our home or something like that
[23/02/2020, 18:16:31] Richard: We want to put a Caveat
[23/02/2020, 18:23:20] Kabum: Wooww
[23/02/2020, 18:24:40] Richard: Nothing concrete but with dad I have learned to expect the worst
[23/02/2020, 18:26:41] Kabum: Well its better to prevent than cure
[24/02/2020, 19:26:32] Tiano: So the builders are done, they will wind up tomorrow. The remaining part is kusereka.

We shall wait till we have enough money for kusereka then we shall ask them to continue.
[24/02/2020, 19:27:50] Tiano: We owe them labour of 210k for what they ve done thus far. Preferably they should get this latest tomorrow morning.
[25/02/2020, 13:54:27] Richard: Sending this but I need to see what he has done? Did they put some type of beam? Or is he just going to leave it as bricks?
[25/02/2020, 13:55:22] Richard: Also he can’t leave yet once Mathew sends the promised 300k I will send the rest of the amount for roofing
[25/02/2020, 13:56:32] Richard: Dad reducesd his age on this license. He was born in 1948

[04/03/2020, 18:41:42] Tiano: has anyone dreamt about mum lately.
[04/03/2020, 19:22:55] Tiano: I think we need to always spare sometime everyday and pray for mum, all of us. I had a dream and I think she misses us.
[04/03/2020, 23:57:45] Richard: We do and will continue doing
[05/03/2020, 01:47:36] Angelo(us): We’ll Continue to Pray. I haven’t dreamed of Her
[05/03/2020, 02:21:57] Richard: Meanwhile. I talked to Mama Namuli extensively today. She says she has been trying to speak to Mathew.
[05/03/2020, 02:22:22] Richard: Mbu Mama Resty has said they will have their own Lumbe on the 24
[05/03/2020, 02:23:00] Richard: Apparently before all this she was already saying that Lumbe should be in the village instead of home in Busega
[05/03/2020, 02:23:14] Richard: So I told her I am not fighting over this anymore.
[05/03/2020, 02:23:58] Richard: We shall have either thanksgiving or Lumbe at the home on the 17 as planned and then return here. I will not be going to Lubira

[05/03/2020, 04:17:14] Richard: I told mama Namuli that we moved from then we haven’t even talked about it amongst us
[05/03/2020, 04:17:58] Richard: I explained to her they all of us are so busy we have no energy to direct towards that as we barely have enough time to discuss the other things that affect us directly
[05/03/2020, 12:09:27] Angelo(us): Will be on the road to Pittsburgh today anyone free can call me and we catch up

[14/03/2020, 20:16:53] Richard: I think give it take 500 to 700 or less. Mom had so many friends but we also have to put into consideration people from the village and the local ones in Busega
[14/03/2020, 20:17:30] Richard: I think this is fine document to circulate but we need an account guys
[14/03/2020, 20:17:47] Richard: To help us manage this and other things with ease

[15/03/2020, 20:10:00] Tiano: I have issues with finance management so i think one of you should open and just share the account number, we can always deposit to it
[15/03/2020, 20:10:49] Tiano: Also i think we need to pass the budget to a chef and see what the quantities should be basing on the 500- 700 people

[30/03/2020, 14:45:05] Kabum: What's up guys..been seeing and hearing all the  madness going on about this corona virus..the information in that audio is the only information that makes sense to me living in NYC which they say is the epicenter of the "virus" and they so happened to role out 5G WiFi boxes on the streets in some parts of the city and telecom companies are rolling it out for their customers..all these shutdowns are uncalled for and the consequences are going to be crazy for most people..please listen..do your own research and question everything because am sure something seems off to most people about this whole thing..

[30/03/2020, 14:47:16] Kabum: She always took good care of herself
[30/03/2020, 14:49:16] Kabum: Its a long one but worth a listen
[30/03/2020, 16:41:24] kaksmat US: Thanks man, i have been saying all along that I'm skeptical about Bill gates' efforts to vaccinate etc.
[30/03/2020, 17:12:51] Richard: I think this is a conspiracy theory that is not easy to validate
[30/03/2020, 17:22:50] kaksmat US: True, one question though is how China managed to cub matters that fast
[30/03/2020, 17:29:15] Richard: Important question
[30/03/2020, 17:29:32] Richard: Given how densely populated they are
[30/03/2020, 17:32:29] kaksmat US: Ya, its complicated
[30/03/2020, 17:59:13] Angelo(us): I have seen another article sometime last i think saying He has a Lab in West Africa where they are modifying mosquitoes to kill the continent
[30/03/2020, 17:59:48] Angelo(us): I saw a separate article actually talking about the dangers of 5G but i never paid attention
[30/03/2020, 18:00:51] Angelo(us): But i think this Speaker goes far beyond and sounds more like a consipiracy but when you look at Putin wanting to stay president as a dictator and the one of China and others then ........
[30/03/2020, 18:11:18] Richard: Tulabye
[30/03/2020, 18:12:09] Richard: So
Many things are far beyond what an everyday person can comprehend
[30/03/2020, 18:19:42] Angelo(us): Indeed
[30/03/2020, 18:22:27] Richard: I don’t know if u used to watch Scandal
[30/03/2020, 18:23:10] Richard: It essentially implied that there was a group of exclusive power guys who controlled the government and engineered everything that happened
[30/03/2020, 18:30:17] Angelo(us): Yah
[30/03/2020, 18:40:14] Kabum: Might sound like a conspiracy but you cant essentially rule out everything he mentions in there
[30/03/2020, 18:44:39] Richard: True! You also can’t take it as the gospel truth. 😁
[30/03/2020, 18:49:08] Kabum: That’s true too, if you realize he kept talking and giving reference to developing he’s crypto currency so at some point i thought it might just be abt that

[30/03/2020, 23:16:12] Richard: It’s going to sweep through
[30/03/2020, 23:18:22] kaksmat US: Ya but they need the humor to manage. They are need used to staying indoor like us who do so coz of winter
[30/03/2020, 23:27:04] Kabum: But everything is turned into humor..hehehe
[30/03/2020, 23:27:21] kaksmat US: of course, thats bad
[30/03/2020, 23:27:31] Angelo(us): They should event remove social media tax
[30/03/2020, 23:27:43] Angelo(us): People will die of stress
[30/03/2020, 23:27:55] Angelo(us): Online can help with the boredom
[30/03/2020, 23:28:06] Kabum: So then you miss which is critical and what isn’t
[30/03/2020, 23:28:31] kaksmat US: by the way even here people don't care. Over the weekend, they arrested a guy here in NJ, he organised a party and had 47 people
[30/03/2020, 23:28:37] Kabum: They are instead going to die from hunger and starvation, God for bid

[09/04/2020, 18:02:14] kaksmat US: You in Uganda for example, they shut down the public transport system, then people begun dying in hospitals because nurses couldn't make it to work. Many NY people rely on the public system (including essential workers).
[09/04/2020, 18:15:59] Richard: But how many people have died in Uganda compared to the ones that would have died if they didn’t enforce the ban on free movement?
[09/04/2020, 18:16:13] Richard: It’s temporary but will help
Resolve a lot of issues
[09/04/2020, 18:19:05] kaksmat US: In NY if they do that then nurses won't make it to hospital and more people will die
[09/04/2020, 18:19:40] kaksmat US: their is a lockdown in the city. Only essential staff are being allowed to moved
[09/04/2020, 18:20:24] kaksmat US: For example, at my workplace, they forwarded the names of everyone who needs to office to the city administration
[09/04/2020, 18:20:40] kaksmat US: and they where issues with a permit sort of
[09/04/2020, 18:29:51] kaksmat US: they even brought in nurses from other states to support the system. They checked them into hotels and they are paying a danger allowance
[09/04/2020, 18:58:30] kaksmat US: Reminds me of Kagulire's challenge

[10/04/2020, 04:40:11] Richard: My daughter asks me and the boys don’t
[10/04/2020, 04:40:57] kaksmat US: Ya she is naturally very observant and many timesout of the blue she will ask you a question about something you have forgotten

[11/04/2020, 15:07:38] Kabum: *Response to Claims of a COVID-19 cure by Biobert Research group*

11th April 2020

Opio Samuel
Secretary, Pharmaceutical Society of Uganda 

Over the past few days there has been a you tube Video and a letter circulating on social media on a COVID-19 cure by a one Robert Mijumbi,an independent researcher and a university graduate in biology with experience in molecular medicine.

The researcher claims to have designed an enzyme(protein) which he previously administered intravenously  to one patient who he claims to have been cured of HIV.He  further states that he  has a belief that through the same procedure  he has developed  a cure for COVID-19.

First and  foremost , what has been fronted is a hypothesis or scientific thought for treatment of COVID-19 and not a cure for COVID-19 as the title of the letter suggests.It is important at this point to guide the public and Robert about drug research. Use of proteins as a means of treatment falls broadly  under a term called biologics.This is a growing area. Most drug treatments have been  chemicals in nature  such as paracetamol and produced through chemical synthesis involving a few chemical reactions.

Biologics however, is a more advanced and sophisticated process which can be done either through use of micro-organism cells or direct synthesis of the biologics. A common example is insulin,a protein which is produced by removing the human insulin Gene and inserting it into the Gene of the bacteria or animal or cell to produce the insulin.In essence, one uses the body of a micro-organism,a cell or even an animal as a biological factory to produce the medicine as opposed to a chemical factory.

The biggest challenge is not it's production however ,but the purification process which has to be done to avoid introduction of the bacteria,cell or animal components including even it's diseases into the patient through the insulin injection.To date ,there are only a handful manufacturers of insulin in the world.Vaccines are another example of biologics. There are other more complex methods for production of proteins and enzymes  which would need highly sophisticated equipment and advanced techniques to produce.

Secondly, production of any new drug requires it to undergo pre-clinical studies which are known as in vitro(outside the human body) studies such as in an animal model like a guinea pig or mice that mimics a human model and  clinical trials which has to be done in vivo (inside the human body) to determine it's efficacy and safety.

In light of the above, it is therefore important to state the following from Biobert's research claims.

📌 As an independent researcher, it is important to cite the lab where he has been conducting his research.As highlighted, the level of sophistication needed to produce an enzyme  is quite high unless he has developed a much simpler method to do so.In addition,the said lab would need to have capabilities of handling viruses for him to have carried out the HIV experiments!

📌He cites having administered his product  intravenously to an HIV patient. Any product administered intravenously has to be sterile and hence needs a highly controlled environment to do so.Being a protein, makes it even more complex since it cannot be sterilized by commonly applied methods such as a autoclave sterilization that uses steam .Proteins are heat sensitive and would need advanced filtration methods to purify.

📌 The researcher cites one key patient as evidence for cure of HIV/AIDS.It is important to note that evidence of cure has to be sufficient without bias and one patient cannot suffice to claim it as an HIV cure.Hundreds of patients have to be tested.One would also need to rule out the possibility that the patient was on ARVs at the same time he administered his drug. However,his pre-liminary findings  could show that the product could be useful in HIV patients.The extent of its usefulness nevertheless  will  necessitate further studies to be carried out both at pre-clinical and clinical trial level.

📌The researcher further talked about the efficacy of the product but didn't mention any adequate  findings on its safety.Among the greatest concern on biologics is their safety, especially if not well purified.This is moreso due to the  presence of other materials and impurities that are components of proteins during production.Their non-removal can trigger adverse reactions in the human body.

📌The researcher claims that  he has strong belief that the same drug and approach could yield positive results for a cure for COVID-19 and has created a protein as a result.This is merely a hypothesis though presented as a  fact without experimentation in the title of the letter. Such statements are unprofessional. As a result,some section of the public have responded by asking him to infect himself with the Coronavirus and confirm whether his treatment works.

📌In addition, enzymes are highly specific on their targets as he says and operate through a lock and key hypothesis.A key that starts a Toyota landcruiser is unlikely to ignite a Mercedes Benz.Likewise,because it worked on an HIV virus doesn't guarantee that it will work on a Coronavirus.If that was the case,the ARVs would have easily worked for COVID-19 patients.

Mr Robert Mijumbi should therefore desist from creating unnecessary  anxiety among the public as it can derail ongoing government efforts in containing the COVID-19 pandemic by creating a false sense of security.In addition,it makes the public question our compencies as scientists especially when we make unverified claims.He should rather focus on engaging National drug authority,Ministry of health ,Uganda National council of science and technology and various scientists to better guide him on his research.

There are mechanisms of doing this without revealing the intellectual property details of his innovation.In this way, it will build confidence    to other scientists and the public of his research.Engaging in you tube videos only  makes others  perceive him with caution and suspicion even if his intentions are good as witnessed recently where a group of super genuises were instead mistaken as super conmen!

Mr Kijumbi ,let the clinical  trials and experiments on your drugs talk for you not the you tube videos.

The SMACKOBA fraternity has lost of one its gallant sons, *Paul Kyegombe, Kiwanuka House, 1985-91*

Paul just passed on in Atlanta, Georgia, US. We are all in shock. He was a pillar in our community and loved by all.

Paul was one of the top students in Uganda, PLE 1984 whilst at Kisubi, Savio. He was the Top student at O'Levels 1988 (6 in 6, 10 in 8), and one of the Top students at A'Levels (AAAA). He was admitted to read Engineering at Makerere University, 1991, and soon after got a scholarship to study Architecture at Huddersfield University, UK. He graduated with Honours in 1998, and started working for Dyer Brown Architects in the UK. Soon after, he relocated to Atlanta, Georgia to continue his architecture work with Dyer Brown. Many years later, he started his own practice in the city. He was also an avid professional artist, who earned a good living from his artwork, specialising in oil on canvas. His paintings were much admired.

A true intellectual, friend and great person. He will be missed by all who studied, played football and worked with him. The deceased is survived by a son, Solomon.

MAY HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE

[15/04/2020, 20:51:23] Richard: Tribute from an OB

He was the brightest and most talented student EVER to have gone through Uganda's Education system and this is no EXAGGERATION!! .. His accomplishments at PLE, O'LEVEL AND A LEVEL were astonishing.
But it's was not only at academics that Paul stood out. He was a gifted sports man and artist (sculpture and paintings) playing football for SMACK school team, basketball, Tennis, Athletics, playing the Church Piano on Sundays and coaching both French and German classes for juniors who requested for help.
Personally, I will remember him as a genius who was successful at everything and I mean everything except disguising his intellect and talents. No matter how much he tried to hide them, he still stood out,
The Smack flag MUST be raised at half mast to commemorate the fallen genius.
Kitalo nyo.
May his soul rest in eternal peace.
[15/04/2020, 20:51:23] Richard: Kyegombe Paul

You could tell that he was different. He was special.

Insanely cool, frighteningly bright, intellectually brilliant, laid back, artistic beyond words, . . .  I mean, his paintings almost jumped at you! You just had to take a second look. His artworks were and are still almost incomparable. The way he played about with those colours will forever amaze me. Two or three people tried to match him at the painting, a gentleman that I haven’t seen in years called Mackee, Dr. Roy William Mayega Arch. Golooba Edward P Kayiso these guys were all brilliant at art, and yet again, you could see that Kyegombe’s paintings were. . . different.  

Perhaps this would explain why some of the kids would spend their sports time watching him paint.

The Art class at St. Mary's College Kisubi - SMACK run for about four hours, starting at about 2:15pm to around 6:15pm. Sports time was around 4:30pm to 7pm. 
Every once in a while, we could see a number of the college students, gathered around someone painting, something ordinary like the School main hall. Many times it was Kyegombe they gathered around. But when you saw what he was painting, it could take your breath away! 
He would see things that others were not seeing and paint them. His paintings, so full of life. I think that is why the kids sat there and watched in awe as he did his thing.

After the art class, which happened about once a week, he would dash to his dorm, change into sportswear, pick up his soccer boots and go play with his mates. He loved football.

I first heard of Paul Kyegombe in 1988 when I joined SMACK for my Senior 1. Almost immediately, we all got to learn that there is a student in the school called Kyegombe. He is undoubtable the brightest student at St. Mary’s they told us. He was in Senior 4 at that time. Three classes ahead of us.

 

I guess it’s one of the things that you think about when you join a top class institution of learning where most of the kids scored perfect scores to get into. Who is the brightest person in this institution of bright ones?

Kyegombe it was. There was no mistake about that. Some came close, but in terms of being an all-round simple and intelligent gentleman, he was in his own class.

When he sat for his O-levels, he scored a 6 in 6. Back then, scoring a 6 in 6 was very rare. These days its appears common. In the 80s, it was near to impossible.
Kyegombe did just that. Then he came back to SMACK to do his A-levels.

And thus his dilemma. At that time, it was strictly a maximum of 4 Principal subjects. He chose to do Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Biology and French and Art.

That makes it 6 subjects isn’t it? I don’t know how it did. I heard that he was forced to drop out of the French Class, but he was the best in French at that time. A friend of mine commented that, 
“Kyegombe would speak French with Mr. Kamanzi, our French teacher as if he was speaking Luganda". Flowing seamlessly!! 
Incredible grasp of the language that was incomprehensible at the time.

He scored four As in Physics, Chemistry Mathematics and Biology AAA/A. It was the very first time I heard ever heard of someone scoring perfect scores in such tough subjects. He could have chosen to do medicine. He chose to do Architecture and he excelled at it, winning several awards and Founding the Architectural firm ArchTecton Architects in Atlanta USA

I didn’t know him personally that much. But I very much knew that he was a genius. Totally. No question about that. My brother Steven Kwizera knew him much better, and they have kept in touch. He told me that they last communicated about two weeks ago.

And now he rests.

A very sad day for everyone that is only made a little but brighter by the fact that I believe that he did deliver on his promise.

 A promise to do awesome things.

Thank you Sir.

The world will miss him dearly.

A football team comprised of mainly Ugandans in Atlanta will miss him. He was their coach and affectionately called him "Coach P" 

The SMACK OBs will miss him dearly.

He did epitomise the school Motto, Duc in Altum, Launch in the Deep.

His family and friends will miss him lots.

Fare thee well Arch. Paul Kyegombe.

One of Uganda's finest

May his soul Rest in Eternal Peace.

[17/04/2020, 20:54:21] Richard: CONDOLENCE MESSAGE FROM St. MARY’S COLLEGE KISUBI TO THE FAMILY OF ARCHITECT PAUL KYEGOMBE (1971 - 2020) FOLLOWING HIS SUDDEN DEATH IN ATLANTA  - USA.

It is with great shock that we learnt of the death of Architect Paul Kyegombe who had his earlier education in schools managed by the Brothers of Christian Instruction. We as the community of St. Mary’s College, Kisubi see this as a very big blow. Paul has been a living testimony of the good foundation that the Brother headed academic institutions impart into students for academic excellence.

I, and fellow members of the St. Mary’s College Kisubi Community wish to express our sympathy to the family of Paul as well as his dear son Solomon upon this great loss which occurred in Atlanta - USA where he has been a leader in the Atlanta Uganda Community and was greatly loved. It is not easy to eulogize Paul given his unique attributes.

Paul Kyegombe was at Savio Junior School for his Upper Primary and he sat for PLE In 1984 where he excelled and joined St. Mary’s College, Kisubi from 1985 to 1991. He was in Kiwanuka House. While at St. Mary’s College, one would once in a while see students gathered around someone painting, many times it was Kyegombe. His paintings were so full of life.

He loved playing football, at the same time he was known to be very intelligent in class. Although he was intelligent, he was down to earth. He was simple and always excelled in his subjects. It is said that Kyegombe would speak French with the French teacher as if he were speaking Luganda.

He was a top student at St. Mary’s O ‘ level section in 1988 where he got 6 in 6 and 10 in 8. He was one of the top students at A ‘ level where he offered: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Fine Art. He got 4 Principal As. He then joined Makerere University for Engineering in 1991. He eventually got a scholarship to study Architecture at Huddersfield University, UK where he graduated with honours in 1998.

He started his working career with Dyer Brown Architects in UK. He was posted to Atlanta - Georgia where he continued working with Dyer Brown. 

He later started his own practice as an Architect trading by the name ArchTecton still in Atlanta, and he won several awards in Architecture. He at the same time proved an excellent artist out of which works he earned good living as he specialized in Oil and canvas painting.

He has been a Soccer Coach of a football team in Atlanta where he was called “Coach P”

Kyegombe was recognized by the White House in 2015 for his paintings of President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.

Paul Kyegombe lived to the school motto of “Launch in the deep”.

We thank God for his successful career life.

We pray that the Almighty comforts the family members and also grants Paul Kyegombe eternal Rest.

Rev. Brother Deodati Aganyira.
Head Teacher
St. Mary’s College, Kisubi (SMACK).

Racist and homophobic president- u must be confused 🤷🏽‍♂️
[18/04/2020, 15:07:06] kaksmat US: It's your belief that he is racist.
[18/04/2020, 15:09:28] kaksmat US: You need to know that its beyond the person of the president and more about the agenda of Democrats
[18/04/2020, 15:11:32] kaksmat US: Which i believe i don't need to list hear since you probably know better than me

[18/04/2020, 15:19:47] Richard: Trump is a racist! Go do ur research
[18/04/2020, 15:19:55] Richard: There is a million videos out there

[18/04/2020, 15:40:22] kaksmat US: Ya, no need to argue with me. I have no control over what you think or believe so I can't change it. And the reverse is true.

[18/04/2020, 16:14:01] Richard: Just be informed atleast
[18/04/2020, 16:14:11] Richard: So we can have a conversation
[18/04/2020, 16:14:15] Richard: Not argument
[18/04/2020, 16:14:24] Richard: Conversation 😃
[18/04/2020, 16:18:43] kaksmat US: There is a lot of information out there that we both don't know. The point is who is your source of information and what information do you choose to believe. I can as well simply say you are ignorant considering the information I have about Trump and why he is president today, which I'm certainly sure you don't know hence your hatred toward him.
[18/04/2020, 16:22:01] Richard: If i am watching a video of trump talking I’ll about blacks what more information do I need to determine that he is racist?

[18/04/2020, 16:25:52] kaksmat US: For example did he say he doesn't want blacks or he doesn't want foreigners?
[18/04/2020, 16:26:07] kaksmat US: I'm done i believe

By Prossie Nambatya

I spent all morning going through the COVID-19 Supplementary Budget  Schedule and the Report of the Budget Committee. I share my findings so that everyone can understand the state of affairs in this lovely country. 

1. The COVID Supplementary Budget presented on 31st March amounted to UGX 284BN! Please note that in March alone, the government had presented three different supplementary budgets. The first one presented on 3rd March 2020 was a request for UGX 662.337BN. Then on 19th March, the government requested for another UGX 749.82BN of which 90BN was for State House, 6.98BN for Office of Prime Minister and UGX 4.075BN for Bamugemereirwe Commission (I am not sure why they need any more money considering that their impact has been negligible and they keep incurring more and more expenditures). So in one month of March alone, the government has obtained over a Trillion in just supplementary budgets.
PS: Expenditures over 3% of the approved budget legal limit always require Parliamentary approval.

2. Back to the COVID budget, this money would come from a loan of 600 Million Euro that the government borrowed from the EU.

3. The Ministry of Health requested for UGX 82,562,065,127BN for COVID. The Committee instead decided to give them more and hence they will be getting UGX 104,188,234,110! Out of this, Ministry is paying UGX 3.2BN to hotels where they are quarantining people. No wonder they are holding people by force even after 24 days of quarantine! Food for COVID suspects is to cost UGX 3.364BN but then there is also another budget line called "welfare and food for quarantined individuals in other institutions" which is another UGX 2BN! So in short, feeding Uganda's current 55 patients and any more that come up will cost UGX 3.364 and those in isolation and quarantine (not yet sick) is another UGX 2BN. Over 5bn on food! Hehehehe. Teaching case workers to manage COVID patients is another UGX 1.5BN. Transport alone is UGX 5BN! I could go on and on about the funny items under here but I guess you get the picture.

4. Security sector asked for UGX 81.4BN for surveillance, case detection, case management (not sure why security is doing work of Health) and enforcement. They will get UGX  77.5BN.

5. Local government which includes your RDCs asked for UGX 36.2BN.  RDCs wanted UGX 7.5BN for fuel, UGX 4.8 for 20 isolation centers per district (this was so funny considering that people are actually being centrally isolated under Ministry of Health and we definitely dont need 20 per district), UGX 1.3BN for surveillance teams (please note that as at this point of my analysis, Health and Security above have also got money for this same item), UGX 2BN for coordination by DHOs and another UGX 50M per district for operations.  The Committee decided that this money will be sent to State House who will then disburse. Hehehe.

6. Disaster preparedness aka abakawunga nebinjanjalo asked  for UGX 59.4BN. They got their money so hopefully the posho and beans reach you soon.

7. KCCA would not be left out so they also asked for UGX 30.18BN. They need UGX 1.5BN to enforce directives (which security also got money for), UGX 4.18BN for preparedness and coordination (which disaster and preparedness already got money for), UGX 17BN for response and case management (which Ministry of Health already got money for),UGX 3.3BN for water and sanitation (in a city that is under lockdown and where people pay for their own water and sanitation is an everyday duty of KCCA that should already have been provided for). Thankfully the Committee only gave them UGX 2BN!

8. My lovely people at ICT who had requested for UGX 14.72Bn which included UGX 50M just to record studio messages for COVID, 300M to print COVID messages, 300M for call center and payment of staff, UGX 3BN for billboards and UGX 10BN for TV and radio will only get UGX 6Bn. Atleast our extra UGX 7BN lives to see another day, or another thief!

All I see in the Supplementary Budget is everyone fighting to do the work of the Ministry of Health!

9. The Budget Committee Report was not signed by some members who instead decided to author their dissenting report aka minority report. This Report highlights a few interesting facts:

a. Uganda only has 48,231 beds across all health facilities countrywide although it would need 166,800 beds.
b. 39 districts in Uganda do not have a hospital at all. These include Kalangala, Mitoma, Lwengo, Buvuma, Namayingo.
c. There are only 55 functional ICUs in the country and each ICU costs about UGX 280M to set up.
d. There are only 484 ambulances in the entire country of which only 411 are functional and the government only owns 181 ambulances.
e. Although it is Health Ministry at the forefront, security was allocated 29% of the Schedule hence putting it at the forefront of the fight. In short, LDUs beating you is more important than Ministry fighting the disease. Health only got 22% of the allocation, KCCA 11%, Disaster 21% and ICT 5%.
f. The Minority report hence decided that all the supplementary budget be allocated to Health!

I hope this analysis wakes us up to the reality that in this country, God is for us all but money is for a selected few. I hope you remember this fact when we get to the 2021 elections. I hope you remember this when you see people buying new houses, marrying additional wives, buying new monster rides etc. Save this and remember to hold your leaders accountable!

[07/05/2020, 15:18:54] kaksmat US: *Cycling is bad for the Economy*

Hilarious but true too   Sanjay Thakrar, CEO at Euro Exim Bank Ltd.  got economists thinking when he said :  
A cyclist is a disaster for the country's economy  - He does not buy the car & does not take car loan  - Does not buy car insurance  - Does not buy Fuel  - Does not send his car for servicing & repairs  - Does not use paid Parking  - Does not become Obese  - Yes,.....and well, damn it !!  Healthy people are not needed for economy. They do not buy drugs. They do not go to Hospitals & Doctors.  They add nothing to country's GDP.  On the contrary, every new McDonald outlet creates at least 30 jobs - 10 Cardiologists, 10 Dentists, 10 weight loss experts apart from people working in McDonald outlet.  Choose wisely: A Cyclist or a McDonald ?   Worth thinking.

PS. _walking is even worse. they do not even buy a bicycle._
[07/05/2020, 15:31:46] Richard: Lol or even subscribe to gym membership
[07/05/2020, 18:11:07] Kabum: Woowww

[10/05/2020, 01:51:29] Kabum: I know you’re right its a good thing to make friends but some people esp here are so reserved and tend to hold back when it comes with contacts. Its a thing I’ve noticed with a couple of people I’ve interacted with

[11/05/2020, 01:59:51] Richard: Why was it a MUST for a girl to get married while still a virgin in Buganda? 

A dedication to Mothers on this 2020 Mothers Day

What went racing in your mind as you read the title of this message? Contrary to what most people think, the traditional Muganda (I limit myself to a nation whose traditional norms I can discuss) seemed to know a thing or two about modern biology and medicine, something that is a mystery to many.

1. Genetically, we carry more of our Mother's genes than our Father's. That is because of little organelles that live within our cells called mitochondria which we only receive from our Mothers. It was important for the family not to import dangerous goods (mitochondria) into their lineage! Traditionally, when you have intercourse with someone, all his/her spirits get embedded in you, likewise for your partner. Now, no normal (clean) family wished to import evil spirits (devil worshipping, cannibalism, murderers, sly foxes, chronicle diseases, suicide tendencies etc.) into their lineage. On the other hand, they wished to import successful spirits into their lineage. The only way to ensure that was to marry a virgin who has been subjected to a thorough investigation to rule out genes of evil spirits so that during first intercourse, an importation of evil spirits is ruled out. By the way this was also the case on the girl's side. Her family didn't wish their daughter to import evil spirits into their family, remember that nephews and nieces have special roles to play on the maternal side.

2. The second point taken into consideration by our ancestors was the super fecundation factor. Super fecundation is the fertilisation of two or more ova from the same cycle by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse which can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers. The Buganda knew the possibility of this happening. In order to rule it out since it might lead to what they were trying to avoid in No. 1 above, the only way was to ensure that the bride was a virgin. 

This explains why all sorts of taboos were endorsed to ensure that even the girl herself enforces her chasteness. That way, we had a generally clean society void of evil deeds and chronicle diseases as compared to today's society. Generation curses were ruled out, or at least they were minimised. If nature played it's role and one imported into his/her family evil spirits unknowingly as a result of a generation curse, then remedies were introduced into play. A comparison in the Bible would be found in Proverbs 10:1 and 1 Corinthians 7:12 - 14.

In conclusion, the traditional society before the introduction of Islam and Christianity knew the crucial role a Mother plays in the formation of a family and continuation of desirable genes in society. Therefore testing, testing 1,2,3 was taboo! What a wonderful phenomenon. To those successful citizens, don't forget to thank God because it is only by His Grace that you, your partner and offspring are healthy, free from health/mental disorders, and successful in life. Happy Mother's Day to you all the fair sex🌹🙏

[11/05/2020, 20:20:11] Kabum: The 20 bucks a month could be handy in something esle
[11/05/2020, 20:20:56] Richard: We are not being charged
[11/05/2020, 20:21:18] Richard: The actual GYm is closed to they can’t charge our account
[11/05/2020, 20:23:33] Kabum: All gyms here operate with an automatic e-payment every month on the date you started your subscription
[11/05/2020, 20:25:22] Richard: It can’t be all!
[11/05/2020, 20:25:27] Richard: Everything is negotiable
[11/05/2020, 20:25:57] Richard: If u called and insisted that u need the amount to stop being drafted they will stop
[11/05/2020, 20:26:23] Kabum: Its that way boss
[11/05/2020, 20:26:56] Kabum: I’ve seen people selling out there subscriptions bse they can’t cancel them
[11/05/2020, 20:27:07] Richard: I learned not to ever let anyone take my money for nothing. So many times it’s about arguing with someone once.. you will be supprised if I tell you that they are banking on that attitude
[11/05/2020, 20:27:17] Richard: These are different times though
[11/05/2020, 20:27:29] Richard: If they are not providing the service they can’t keep charging you
[11/05/2020, 20:27:51] Richard: If ur canceling the contract while they are open and operating yeah
[11/05/2020, 20:28:35] Kabum: It’s always a year’s contract and it renews automatically if you don’t cancel a month to the start of the next
[11/05/2020, 20:29:18] Richard: Ok
[11/05/2020, 20:29:35] Richard: I would try to negotiate my way out of the charges
[11/05/2020, 20:29:47] Richard: I think there is a way there
[11/05/2020, 20:32:10] Kabum: You’re right abt this
[11/05/2020, 20:32:37] kaksmat US: What you are describing Richard is more of an american thing than elsewhere
[11/05/2020, 20:33:07] kaksmat US: I was surprised that you can easily take back stuff you bought
[11/05/2020, 20:33:14] kaksmat US: unlike in Uganda

[11/05/2020, 20:42:49] Richard: If this gym isn’t canceling it would be gym specific. But over all ur more likely to get ur money back in other places than this capitalistic country
[11/05/2020, 21:30:13] Kabum: Hehehe..how many years ago??
[11/05/2020, 21:30:35] Tiano: anti kale

[13/05/2020, 22:52:22] kaksmat US: *COVID-19 HOME QUARANTINE with RISE IN INCEST CASES:*

 _A MUST READ_ 

I am a 54 year old woman, widowed and mother of three children - a boy of 17yrs and two girls of 15yrs and 13yrs. I am an international civil servant and a practising Christian. 
 
I am not writing to you to look for a spouse but to send a heartfelt cry to all parents and also to ask for advice.

In fact, I live with my three children, in my house, I am usually at the office all day long and except weekends when I am at home. 
 
And since the authorities stopped the classes, I have forbidden my children to go out, they are confined since the beginning, there is only the cleaning girl who comes to work and leave. 
 
As for the children, I keep a close eye on them but today I am overwhelmed by what is happening. 
 
Every month I check that my daughters are well, because the older one often has stomach aches when she is in good health, so I get along each time. 
 
But odd enough in April she didn't show anything, and I noticed early signs of pregnancy, so I asked her to collect some of her urine for me yesterday morning, and then I did the GIT which turned out positive. 
 
It didn't tell me much, in the evening I went back to her room to discuss calmly with her to find out who is the author of this pregnancy. 
 
To my great surprise it is with tears in her eyes that she told me that it is her older brother. and that since the cessation of classes this is what they do at home when I'm not there, and even with the youngest. that's when I remembered that she too is not in period for a long time because her period began at the age of 11 years. so I undertook to do hers too, unfortunately it turned +ve too. 
 
Again as calmly as I could, I called my son to ask him what really happened. 
 
He admitted the facts with his sisters, and he has been out of the house since last night and I haven't heard from him.

I really need your advice, I am devastated, I see my dreams shattered after so many years of consecration. My husband has been dead since 2009 and I am in charge of everything. 

I don't know what to do, I want to see my children grow up together and become responsible people but with what is happening to me, I have no strength left in me.

I have thought about abortion but I am a believer and my faith doesn't allow me.

I am traumatised. What do I do?
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

[22/05/2020, 18:49:49] kaksmat US: *WHEN THE GAME IS OVER,..  WE SHALL ALL RETURN HOME.*

A boy was sent by his father to urgently buy him food from a restaurant. On his way going, he was in a hurry because of the urgency of the assignment.

_However, on his way back, he passed where his mates were playing football. He  slowed down, began to watch the game, gradually slowing down until he finally stopped. He watched for a while and got carried away, he became interested, and indicated his interest in playing, he was invited._

_He left the food in the care of some unknown people and entered the field. He forgot the assignment completely and played his heart out. He became the man of the match, dribbled opponents, created chances, scored goals and changed the face of the entire game._

_When night came, the owner of the ball picked it up. It was time for everyone to go home; to go back to their parents, the game was over!_

_It now dawned on the boy after everyone had left that he had actually been sent to buy food by his hungry father. He went to where he kept the food, it had already been eaten by goats and dogs, "but I kept this food with some guys here a moment ago."_ He said.

_He picked the plates, but was no longer happy, all the excitement of the game disappeared, the people clapping for him were all gone, the opponents he was playing against were all gone, the ball itself was gone, time was gone, those selling food were gone, he couldn't buy another!

_Regrets took over him, he sluggishly walked home, with tears of sorrow and regrets whilst hiding in the dark._

_When people saw him, they asked him why he was crying and hiding in the dark with empty plates! He had left with clean plates full of excitement, but returned with same empty plates, so dirty and stained !_

_When they asked him "Why he couldn't go home, he said his father will beat him". He knew the implications of a wasted time. So sad, too late._
 
_Hear this: We have a home and a Father to return to at the end of life's journey when all is said and done._

_Don't be distracted, don't rejoice when people are clapping for you while doing the wrong things, they won't be there when you are to give an account._

_Avoid Distractions, we are sent here for an assignment, the Father is waiting for us, this ball we are busy playing, when night comes, the owner will pick it, the crowd will disappear, we'll be left alone to go back and give a report to our Maker. What will you tell Him ?_

_Think about it._

 *WHEN THE GAME IS OVER,..  WE SHALL ALL RETURN HOME*

[09/06/2020, 01:22:21] Richard: Man a lot of this is BS. The point about everything starting from home is important though.  You asked me why sometimes I speak to Ethan the way I do. It’s because if I don’t, he will end up speaking back to the cops and that’s how these kids get shot
[09/06/2020, 01:23:29] Richard: I would rather be rude to him and treat him with a bit of hostility now, because at the same time I make sure he is confident and built back up but is respectful and responsible
[09/06/2020, 01:23:59] Richard: The truth is u and me may never be shot becouse we can’t allow the situation to escalate
[09/06/2020, 01:24:35] Richard: We were taught to be respectful from early on.
[09/06/2020, 01:57:21] kaksmat US: That's the point

[10/06/2020, 17:19:47] Richard: ENTEBBE AIRPORT PREPARES TO OPEN, ANNOUNCES NEW SAFETY GUIDELINES  !!! 

Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) has tightened measures to contain the spread of Coronavirus ahead of planned opening of Entebbe International Airport. 

In the new measures, departing passengers will now be expected to arrive at the airport *at least four hours before boarding* to go through the Health Port screening procedures.

 They will also be required to present a valid health certificate from the Ministry of Health or undergo a rapid test at the airport before departure. 

All arriving and departing passengers will also be expected to wear face masks and exercise social distancing when airlines resume business.

 Some of the changes at the airport facilities will include providing more space for boarding lounges, installation of automatic sensor non-touchable doors and non-touchable taps, e- boarding pass readers and automated document readers to limit excessive scanning of passports. 

Three big tents have already been erected to ensure passengers observe physical distancing.

[12/06/2020, 06:10:31] Tiano: I guess it depends on how much a good salary is, if it is double what i get now, i doubt they can give me that. but we can rethink if they do.
[12/06/2020, 06:17:10] Richard: Ok
[12/06/2020, 06:18:11] Richard: I was looking at it in a perspective of being able to pay for ur masters and other online courses you will find.
[12/06/2020, 06:19:44] Richard: One thing to keep in mind for sure though is that if Stanbic pays you that much they are going to work you
[12/06/2020, 06:19:59] Richard: Work you properly that you may not be able to actually study
[12/06/2020, 06:20:11] Richard: Atleast that what has happened to a few of my freinds
[12/06/2020, 06:24:15] Tiano: yes, that too. We will have to rethink all these scenarios and see what's best. Situations keep changing, i will just keep my mind open.

[14/06/2020, 13:22:08] Tiano: mbu he cant pay 500k just to confirm what he is sure of,  he says its us who want to confirm, so we should do it ourselves.
[14/06/2020, 13:22:37] Tiano: and he said there are 3 kids, so thats 1.5m
[14/06/2020, 13:22:49] Richard: I was going to pay , we had an agreement
[14/06/2020, 13:23:14] Richard: Then everything flipped last minute.
[14/06/2020, 13:26:21] Kabum: I remember that and it was what I was driving to when Kalule stopped me. 

I guess we should have had a discussion prior like Kalule suggested
[14/06/2020, 13:27:21] Tiano: yah, the problem is you cant have dialogue with dad
[14/06/2020, 13:27:25] Tiano: its hard

[19/06/2021, 14:03:23] Richard: I have tried to call her a few times in vain
[19/06/2021, 14:03:34] Richard: What chest pains? Did she cure from Covid?
[19/06/2021, 14:03:39] Richard: What hospital are you at!
[19/06/2021, 14:04:09] Tiano: she doesnt like having her phone around
[19/06/2021, 14:04:22] Tiano: no, not yet
[19/06/2021, 14:05:23] Tiano: its probably covid
[19/06/2021, 14:06:52] Tiano: its called double cure, its in mpigi,
[19/06/2021, 14:07:01] Champ Matt US: 🙏🏾
[19/06/2021, 14:07:32] Tiano: they say they will put her on some medication, and drip for today tulabe
[19/06/2021, 14:10:42] Kabum: Our prayers to her
[19/06/2021, 14:13:15] Richard: Can we buy an inhaler for her to continue opening up her lungs
[19/06/2021, 14:13:24] Richard: Does she have any breathing issues?
[19/06/2021, 14:13:54] Tiano: she says she has no difficulty in breathing
[19/06/2021, 14:14:25] Tiano: but she feels like wounds in the throat and it makes her really uncomfortable
[19/06/2021, 14:14:53] Richard: That’s not good
[19/06/2021, 14:14:56] Tiano: but yes an inhaler would be a good  idea,
[19/06/2021, 14:15:15] Tiano: am going to see if i can get her one
[19/06/2021, 14:15:25] Richard: Ok please

[19/06/2021, 19:07:34] Richard: Ok
[19/06/2021, 19:07:39] Richard: So what did they treat?
[19/06/2021, 19:12:08] Tiano: ohh her body was also weak, shes feels much stronger, and then the pains were apparently from clots in the lung, something caused by covid, so theres some medication they put in the drip that prevents those.
[19/06/2021, 20:29:23] Champ Matt US: 🙏🏾
[19/06/2021, 22:28:14] Angelo(us): Also Pneumonia has been previously mentioned as an outcome Covid. Maybe its related to the clots
[20/06/2021, 05:40:24] Tiano: i will ask her to check once she heals from covid

[24/06/2021, 15:42:59] Champ Matt US: Hear about it. Made from MUST
[24/06/2021, 16:37:46] Tiano: yeah
[24/06/2021, 16:45:26] Richard: I haven’t heard about it either
‎[24/06/2021, 18:10:23] Kabum: ‎image omitted
[24/06/2021, 18:10:24] Kabum: but apparently they have stopped it’s distribution as it’s not approved by the NDA, however we have got a good number of testimonies from people that have recovered after use
[24/06/2021, 18:10:24] Kabum: Trial and error...  it can work for ue and perhaps not for another person..
[24/06/2021, 18:12:42] Champ Matt US: So what happened, a researcher at MUST Developed it. Then before it would be approved by NDA, thr formulas leaked and people started making it and selling it
[24/06/2021, 18:12:54] Champ Matt US: So NDA intervened.
[24/06/2021, 18:13:29] Champ Matt US: But of course the white man doesn't want to here such things so trust me they will make sure this fails
[24/06/2021, 18:13:39] Tiano: well, that's actually true,
[24/06/2021, 18:13:43] Tiano: same as this
[24/06/2021, 18:15:25] Tiano: government knows about it but Sevo cant declare it authentic because people will cut funding etc etc, and well, its still being sold, many pharmacies have it, same way the de-marketed kazire but people still take it.
[24/06/2021, 18:15:51] Richard: I think Nuhu Rose’s baby daddy makes it
[24/06/2021, 18:16:03] Richard: Kigaji LLC
[24/06/2021, 18:25:28] Tiano: its made in Mbarara University
[24/06/2021, 18:25:42] Tiano: guy is called Ogwang,
[24/06/2021, 18:26:31] Tiano: but you might be right coz the spreading story says the formula leaked , and people started making copies.
[24/06/2021, 18:28:56] Richard: May be
[24/06/2021, 18:29:04] Richard: That’s why “I think”

@256784286046
[10/07/2021, 15:09:20] Tiano: but but 😂😂😂
[10/07/2021, 15:09:34] Richard: Jingo is a hater
[10/07/2021, 15:11:44] Tiano: Messi cant be considered greatest even in his home country coz Maradona won the world cup, 😂😂😂, you guys think copa america will make him the goat?
[10/07/2021, 15:11:47] Tiano: 😂😂😂😂
[10/07/2021, 15:12:14] Champ Matt US: His guy Ronaldo didn't even make it to quarters
[10/07/2021, 15:12:24] Tiano: to me the goat is Pele, 3 world cups.
[10/07/2021, 15:13:02] Tiano: also copa america is played every 2 years. guy has failed since 😤
[10/07/2021, 15:13:04] Champ Matt US: You are just reading about Pele, lets talk about the guys we have seen
[10/07/2021, 15:13:32] Tiano: bit between Ronaldo and Messi, i am Ronaldo all the way.
[10/07/2021, 15:14:16] Champ Matt US: Typical description of a hater
[10/07/2021, 15:15:41] Tiano: madrid had gone 5 seasons without going past last 16 of champs league, then Ronaldo came and they reached semi finals 8 times, in his 9 years there, winning 4 times. talk about impact. 
Portugal had never won any title in football, Ronaldo? now they have the euros and nations league.
[10/07/2021, 15:15:45] Tiano: hehe
[10/07/2021, 15:17:54] Champ Matt US: 6 ballon d'or
[10/07/2021, 15:18:39] Tiano: but anyway is there any 1 season where messi has more goals than games? Christiano has more goals than games in his madrid career. you should google when messi last scored in elclassico, christiano was still a madrid player. 
talk about impact. 

Have you looked at thes in copa America? even Uganda can beat them, see the teams in the euros, and compare.
[10/07/2021, 15:20:25] Tiano: we all know what happened in 2010, pure cheating. Schneider won Champions league, got his team to world cup final. messi won la liga and was top scorer. and then they gave him ballon dor 😂😂😂😂
[10/07/2021, 15:21:29] Champ Matt US: There is always been cheating
[10/07/2021, 15:21:33] Tiano: me i look at their impact, not individual awards, coz those are messed with.
[10/07/2021, 15:21:39] Champ Matt US: But its never recorded
[10/07/2021, 15:22:07] Tiano: naye nga mazima copa america?
[10/07/2021, 15:22:09] Tiano: hehe
[10/07/2021, 15:22:28] Tiano: Sanchez has like 3 copa americas nga ye temumwogelako
[10/07/2021, 15:22:29] Champ Matt US: Have you been watching it
[10/07/2021, 15:23:13] Tiano: those are fake teams nawe, its like fa when man city is drawn with nottingham forest
[10/07/2021, 15:23:33] Richard: I refuse to engage Jingo on this topic
[10/07/2021, 15:24:30] Champ Matt US: Other Argentina playes can't believe Messi pass land exactly on their heads
[10/07/2021, 15:24:47] Tiano: 😂😂😂 nze just i like messi but his impact is really really low, hes only good in la liga and winning it, thats all.
[10/07/2021, 15:25:56] Champ Matt US: Ok let's change the topic, should bring something else to talk about
[10/07/2021, 15:26:31] Champ Matt US: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/soccer/brazil-bra/story/4429785/copa-america-neymar-hits-out-at-brazil-supporters-for-backing-messi-in-final%3fplatform=amp

Even things associated with Horns.

[12/07/2021, 00:36:42] Richard: How do you prove urs self if you have never been a situation with smilar pressure
[12/07/2021, 00:36:52] Richard: There is no simulation for grit

[12/07/2021, 01:02:33] Richard: This is England
[12/07/2021, 01:02:51] Kabum: This is right. Take sancho for example, you haven’t played him whole tournament, he’s confidence is low and you bring him on for a penalty
[12/07/2021, 01:04:06] Champ Matt US: Anyway, gather you views and send them to the coach. For now lets celebrate
[12/07/2021, 01:04:11] Richard: Lol
[12/07/2021, 01:04:43] Kabum: Kale Ssebo😂
[12/07/2021, 01:05:10] Richard: Experience is under rated but for big moments it’s the biggest resource.
[12/07/2021, 01:05:46] Champ Matt US: Ya and we suppose the coach has the necessary experience
[12/07/2021, 01:06:31] Richard: He made a bad decision assuming that becouse Sancho didn’t miss a penalty in Practice he wouldn’t miss here
[12/07/2021, 01:06:39] Champ Matt US: We have seen stars miss penalties
[12/07/2021, 01:06:41] Richard: The kids face was literally shaking
[12/07/2021, 01:07:02] Champ Matt US: 1994 WC Robert Baggio is still on the internet
[12/07/2021, 01:07:04] Richard: Yes, they get nervous too.
[12/07/2021, 01:07:37] Richard: Sancho was not only Nervous
[12/07/2021, 01:07:49] Richard: He had never experienced anything like this before

[12/07/2021, 12:02:45] Richard: Just sharing what a former captain said…
[12/07/2021, 12:03:12] Richard: Although I am sure you don’t know if it’s the coach or the players
[12/07/2021, 12:11:14] Tiano: hehe, i am sure, its not the players who decided that Sancho and Rashford should come in a minute to penalties
[12/07/2021, 12:12:31] Richard: We don’t know who decided Roy Keen said “let/allow” you changed it to “decide”
[12/07/2021, 12:12:44] Richard: Two different meanings
[12/07/2021, 12:14:32] Tiano: all in all the coach calls the shots. abantu boluzungu mutulumya nyo emitwe namwe mulimba 😂😂

[28/07/2021, 00:54:54] Angelo(us): Police said the man and woman were married and got into an argument. Police said the man shot his wife and then himself.
The Clark County Coroner's Office has identified the man as Roy Sentongo, 50, from Las Vegas. His cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in a suicide. 

The woman's identity, cause and manner of death still were pending with the coroner as of Monday afternoon.

[31/07/2021, 18:59:09] Richard: And then demolish the only one and then do the backyard
[31/07/2021, 18:59:18] Richard: That is like a 10m project
[31/07/2021, 19:00:16] Richard: All in all, I don’t want to get into the cameras  coz there are more pressing needs considering moms lumbe is yet to happen and we have had more than enough time work on the home

[03/09/2021, 13:23:48] Champ Matt US: GUN WEILDING GOONS KIDNAP VICTORIA UNIVERSITY VICE CHANCELLOR

Fear and shock engulfed Victoria University early today (2nd September 2021) when heavily armed gunmen raided the Kampala road based University and violently assaulted Dr. Lawrence Muganga (Vice Chancellor of Victoria University) and beat up his bodyguard before dragging them and bundling them into a waiting drone vehicle, and in the ensuing chaos, innocent University students and members of staff who dared to ask questions were roughed-up and beaten by the gun weilding goons.

The violent and high handed manner in which Dr. Lawrence Muganga was kidnapped  and disgraced in broad daylight amidst still unclear circumstances, leaves  alot to be desired as well as many unanswered questions;

 exactly what are the charges (if any)?, why would a civilian be arrested be violently descended on by the military? Why wasn't police involved? Where is he being held?, Why was he manhandled and mistreated? Why would  the security forces that arrested him, violate his rights in the wake of just a fortnight when the President cautioned security  forces against violating the human rights of Ugandans?

 If a Vice Chancellor can be mistreated, beaten up and humiliated by security forces, infront of his staff and students in broad daylight, what about if an ordinary Ugandan with no profile is arrested at night?
[03/09/2021, 13:24:07] Richard: Disgusting
[03/09/2021, 13:27:09] Champ Matt US: Ya

[03/09/2021, 13:46:21] Richard: But something is really wrong with what’s going on in Uganda
[03/09/2021, 13:46:32] Tiano: this country, God honestly needs to intervene.
[03/09/2021, 13:46:46] Richard: I am coming to save you all

[17/09/2021, 01:08:43] Kabum: But i think there wont be enough time from when you go back and when we plan to have it
[17/09/2021, 01:19:20] Richard: I have a total of 6 weeks there but a tone of stuff to do. The kids are in a wedding at the Yiga’s and several Other things
[17/09/2021, 01:19:48] Richard: If it’s to happen we need to plan it ahead but talk to her and get ur feel
[17/09/2021, 01:19:53] Richard: I am open

[17/09/2021, 21:08:23] Champ Matt US: But yours was a little complicated
[17/09/2021, 21:08:30] Champ Matt US: Not generally flat
[17/09/2021, 21:14:41] Champ Matt US: So about this. I won't be able to go to UG in Dec or Jan. My entire team is not allowed to take long leave between Jan and June and in Dec my counterpart is away on home leave for the entire month. But like i mentioned before, it's fine with me if you guys are OK with it. Depending on when in Dec, Lydia and the kids could make it sisnce she wants to go to UG
[17/09/2021, 21:23:17] Richard: I think we should just do what we can. It would be nice for all of us being there together but I don’t know how feasible that is going to be
[17/09/2021, 21:23:33] Richard: She brought it up, I told her I was open
[17/09/2021, 21:24:07] Richard: I was assuming ur initial plans to be there held and I think she said Angelo’ had told her he had plans to go as well
[17/09/2021, 21:25:01] Champ Matt US: Ya, unfortunately there always has been unprecedented uncertainties on my side.
[17/09/2021, 21:25:11] Richard: But honestly let’s just do something simple we can
[17/09/2021, 21:25:53] Champ Matt US: ya thats what i think
[17/09/2021, 21:26:25] Richard: I don’t think anyone can hold it against you for not making it
[17/09/2021, 21:26:43] Richard: After all you will be bankrolling the whole thing from New York😜
[17/09/2021, 21:26:58] Richard: MANHATTAN !!!!!!

[17/09/2021, 21:38:06] Richard: At the end of the day where we talk about it doesn’t matter. If we can’t make it in Dec/ Jan time frame we can’t make it
[17/09/2021, 21:41:52] Angelo(us): Got it.

[11/10/2021, 22:18:44] Richard: Is MTN Public Share Offering a Buy?
By: Livingstone Mukasa 

Ever since it became apparent that MTN Uganda was going to list on the Uganda Stock Exchange I have
been bombarded with calls to advise if it’s a good buy.
Today I got my hand on the MTN Share Offering Prospectus and I immediately went to work on it. You
see, I have a small community of people that consider me their “People’s Professor” and it’s a
responsibility I don’t take lightly. Over the years I have made the right calls investing in Uganda Clays
offering, Stanbic Bank and Safaricom but sitting out CIPLA. From the word go I want to state that I am
not a licensed investment advisor and therefore I am not responsible for the way you use the information
shared below. 

Key Considerations. 

1. It's not a growth offering. The company is not raising money to grow its business rather to pay
its shareholders. As an entrepreneur I don’t generally like these kinds of deals where I am a
replacement for someone who has already made their money.
2. The earnings per share averages 16% per year over the last 5 years. With a dividend policy of not
paying more than 60% of Profits after tax , it translates into a 9.6% in profits against revenue.
Not exciting considering the trouble the company must go through to earn that revenue.
3. MTN routinely outsources major/critical functions like masts and infrastructure provision and
maintenance. This poses a risk of cost overruns/adjustments that are not beneficial to local
ownership.
4. Taking Mobile Money Financial Services (Mobile Money) off the table means that they have
taken the fat out of the meat. It’s interesting to see that the information about Mobile Money
business is liberally included in the prospectus but the business is not.
5. The Convoluted nature of MTN ownership makes me a little bit uncomfortable. Even if I am a
minority shareholder I like to know the people I am doing business with. MTN Ownership
structure involves 4 companies (as in one company owns the other) before you get to MTN
Uganda Limited. In that case it’s hard to know who calls the real shorts. This has tremendous
implications in business because without knowing who they are, they become hard to influence.
6. Revenue growth over the last 5 years for Data and Voice has been slow and it’s likely to decline
especially for Voice. Value extraction from revenue is also low for a technology led company. It
expects Revenue of UGX 2.065 Trillion in 2021 but only 325 Billion in Net Profit after Tax. This
is 15.7% of Revenue and only 9.4% may be declared as dividend.
7. The proceeds from the sale of UGX 895 Billion (if all shares are subscribed) will go to the selling
shareholders and not to pay down debt or expand the business. Yet the company is sitting on
some serious debt of about UGX 612 Billion. In this regard MTN Uganda is a highly leveraged
operation and one that has serious ongoing interest payments to make. It’s interesting to note
that the Lion share of the debt is either originated or Consortium-led by South African Banks
operating in Uganda.
8. In the prospectus MTN says it cannot guarantee a dividend payout every year and states in the
prospectus, a risk of a capital call (asking you to invest more money) in the future. 

If you decide to buy MTN Shares nonetheless, please avoid the following:
a) Don’t borrow money to buy MTN shares.
b) Don’t sell your assets to invest in MTN shares
c) Invest what you can afford to lose or wait out for a long period of time.
d) If you have never bought shares in public offerings, invest some money for learning purposes
and not to earn a fortune.

[11/10/2021, 22:18:50] Richard: Just got this
[11/10/2021, 22:19:05] Richard: Reading through and I will get back with my thoughts
[11/10/2021, 22:19:27] Angelo(us): Folks are discussing it on another forum. Some say something fishy about their valuations
[11/10/2021, 22:20:17] Richard: They did that to us with Cipla
[11/10/2021, 22:20:42] Richard: Mr Yiga is one of the biggest core investors and I told
Him they duped us
[11/10/2021, 22:20:47] Richard: He laughed
[11/10/2021, 22:21:52] Angelo(us): Too simple explanation, I’m sure the government can liquidate or kick out any company at will, also sure those brokerage firms are not collateralized… buy yourselves some crypto coins.  It’s an amateur ponzi scheme.
[11/10/2021, 22:21:52] Angelo(us): Timing of this mini lecture is suspect. MTN is doing a public offering that seems to be more about raising money that paying share holders. And what happened to UMEME shares? Ug stuff is full of intrigue. East African exchange will force some needed regulations
[11/10/2021, 22:21:52] Angelo(us): Sevo is cooking up something. All the valuation is suspect. I was trying to look at fundamentals of MTN but wapi. Even other companies in the exchange have no meaningful or verifiable data. Snake oil
[11/10/2021, 22:22:11] Angelo(us): Some comments from the other side
[11/10/2021, 22:28:20] Kabum: Interesting 🤔

There's a guy with a machine gun next to UNHQ - be careful!
From UN Security
The Security and Safety Service of UNDSS wishes to inform that there is ongoing police activity at 1st Avenue between 42nd and 43rd streets.  
 
All personnel and delegates at UNHQ are hereby requested to shelter in place.   
 
Host country authorities are presently on the scene. The Security and Safety Service is monitoring the situation and will update accordingly.
[02/12/2021, 19:15:58] Champ Matt US: I'm at office today. this guy came with a gun
[02/12/2021, 19:17:13] Richard: Wow
[02/12/2021, 19:17:26] Kabum: Take care man
[02/12/2021, 19:18:05] Champ Matt US: i think he has surrenderd
[02/12/2021, 19:18:30] Angelo(us): Its crazy
[02/12/2021, 19:18:32] Champ Matt US: we have received another broadcast saying we can use the second entrance
[02/12/2021, 19:19:36] Champ Matt US: This is to advise UNHQ occupants that the police activity is ongoing on First Avenue. NYPD have secured the area of concern.  
 
Staff and delegates may enter and exit the premises by vehicle at 42nd street, or by foot at the Visitors Entrance at 46th street.
[02/12/2021, 19:23:52] Champ Matt US: The challenge with such is UN security can't shoot unless the guy actually enteres the UN. Which is crazy coz he can shoot them without entering
[02/12/2021, 19:33:47] Champ Matt US: Situation update: NYPD continue to negotiate with an individual armed with a shotgun on 1st Avenue.

The area of concern is secured by the Police and no UN staff or associates are in danger.

Personnel may continue to safely exit by vehicle at 42nd Street or enter/exit by foot at 46th Street.
[02/12/2021, 19:34:53] Richard: He must be a republincan*😉
[02/12/2021, 19:36:08] Champ Matt US: Republicans don't waste time. We either shoot or we shoot
[02/12/2021, 19:40:42] Richard: Heheh
[02/12/2021, 19:46:47] Kabum: We had a WW2 bomb blast here too yesterday
[02/12/2021, 19:46:58] Kabum: Just next to the main station
[02/12/2021, 19:47:33] Kabum: Germany: WWII bomb explosion injures several near Munich train station

Firefighters in the Bavarian capital said one person was seriously injured in an explosion near a construction site by the station. Train service in the city was suspended for several hours.

[31/12/2021, 15:23:13] Champ Matt US: The sincerity of a *husband* is known during the sickness of his wife. That of a *wife* is known during the financial difficulty of the husband. True love of *children* is known during the old age of the parents.

The true nature of *siblings* is known during distribution of inheritance. 

The *sincerity* of friends is known during hard times. 

The *true relatives* are known when one is far from his country, lonely or sick.

*True love* is known when there is no means of benefit & a *true believer* is known during times of hardship.  

In all, life is the teacher itself*. May we grow in wisdom, understanding and patience. 🙏

1. *Be* careful so you don't *hate* a *lovely* *person* ,  because of a *dirty rumour* you heard about them which was created out of *jealousy* and *envy* .

2. *Try* to *appreciate* those who *gossip* about *you* . It's not easy for *someone* to *leave* their *problems* and *carry* yours on their *head* . 

3.  *Forgive* _betrayals_ but be *careful* with *them* ,because next time they may not *spare* your *life* . 

4. *Even* if you kill *yourself* for some *people*, they will still *complain* that you didn't *die* in a *proper* way. Do your *best* and *leave* the *rest* ,  you can't *satisfy* _human being_ . 

5. *If* you are always *worried* about what *others* are saying about *you* , you will *never* be *happy*.

6. *When* your _blessings_ are getting *closer* ,  your *attacks* become *greater*. Don't look at the *storm*, *God* is the controller of all things he created, and is by your *side*, you're a victor.
   
7. Everybody can not *love* you,  don't *lose* your *peace* over those who *hate* you. 
Those who *convinced* people to hate you can not *convince God* to *hate* you. 

8. The year is ending with December. Thank God for all He has enable you to achieve this year. Don't kill yourself for those once you're yet to achieve, stay connected to God always.
Have confidence in God for with God all things are possible.
Live a lifestyle of gratitude at all times.

Compliment of the season.🥰

[13/02/2022, 19:55:12] Richard: Just wrapping up dinner
[13/02/2022, 19:55:19] Richard: Give me 5
[13/02/2022, 20:55:06] Richard: Forgot to tell you guys too. That I asked two tenants to leave the houses tomorrow
[13/02/2022, 20:55:12] Richard: One has left today
[13/02/2022, 20:55:53] Kabum: did they pay
[13/02/2022, 20:56:04] Richard: He hadn’t paid dad since September and had locked and gone to the village so we asked him to
Come get his things- Dad lost 1.7 but we can start over
[13/02/2022, 20:56:26] Richard: There other guy Joseph met owes 3.4 and he doesn’t seem like he will pay anytime soon
[13/02/2022, 20:56:37] Richard: I have asked him to
Take His things too
[13/02/2022, 20:57:12] Richard: So we can put new people in the houses with new terms
[13/02/2022, 21:02:48] Kabum: Richard i wouldn’t think these guys should just leave. We can find somewhere we can keep his stuff in his presence. Get a new tenant into the house. When he gets the money he’ll come and pick the stuff. That’s what i think
[13/02/2022, 21:05:07] Kabum: If in 6 months they haven’t returned to pick their stuff. Their are property buyers than can take these things
[13/02/2022, 21:17:17] Richard: And where would we keep the stuff?
[13/02/2022, 21:18:17] Richard: If a guy left the stuff and took his TV and all other valuables Dad isn’t receiving any money but the other guys stuff is occupying the houses
[13/02/2022, 21:18:50] Richard: If a guy can’t pay 300k how is he going to pay 3.4?
[13/02/2022, 21:19:08] Richard: Sometimes you just have to be realistic and make calls based on reality
[13/02/2022, 21:19:40] Richard: Help send me a draft tenancy agreement I will print it and we will
Take it from there.
[13/02/2022, 21:22:12] Richard: Kavulu went away with 7.7M if he had left a year earlier it would have been 5.3 or something

[21/02/2022, 22:20:13] Richard: He has to stop not being transparent though
[21/02/2022, 22:21:03] Richard: So he talked to me all this long about everything else and that’ part of selling the car he didn’t mention ??
[21/02/2022, 22:21:18] Richard: Fix or not he should be straightforward with us
[21/02/2022, 22:21:36] Kabum: I mentioned that to him
[21/02/2022, 22:24:34] Richard: I really want to help him re organize things but this stuff really scratches me the wrong way
[21/02/2022, 22:35:37] Kabum: Like i said, he sounds overwhelmed with all this stuff. He appreciated that you’re helping but he also kept saying he doesn’t want to burden us so much
[21/02/2022, 22:36:39] Richard: What stuff though?
[21/02/2022, 22:36:57] Angelo(us): When he gets the Land titles you expect some loans
[21/02/2022, 22:36:58] Kabum: The tenants and everything around him
[21/02/2022, 22:37:15] Kabum: He has no help
[21/02/2022, 22:37:22] Richard: That’s an issue for sure
[21/02/2022, 22:38:23] Richard: He always had help, he just has trouble allowing us to help him the best way we know
[21/02/2022, 22:38:29] Kabum: Best thing is to get him talking
[21/02/2022, 22:39:16] Kabum: You’re right.
[21/02/2022, 22:39:21] Richard: He told me about that title too it’s in process for sure he gave me the surveyors number
[21/02/2022, 22:40:15] Kabum: Felt like the guy trying to get the car is taking advantage of the situation
[21/02/2022, 22:40:43] Richard: That’s what’ happens when he chooses to open to other people instead of us
[21/02/2022, 22:40:55] Kabum: One thing with dad is he won’t open up so much if he’s sober
[21/02/2022, 22:41:00] Richard: Like only God knows what happened between him and Kivumbi
[21/02/2022, 22:41:16] Kabum: Only after he’s had a few he’ll speak his mind
[21/02/2022, 22:41:45] Richard: I will do as much as I am able to
[21/02/2022, 22:42:17] Kabum: All those took advantage of him. Even the other short guy that is i think a brother to Mr Musisi
[21/02/2022, 22:43:15] Kabum: I got him a new phone btw. A friend will have delivered next week i guess
[21/02/2022, 22:43:30] Richard: Thank you
[21/02/2022, 22:44:13] Kabum: Its a simple Samsung but it should do the job

[23/02/2022, 18:36:59] Kabum: But there won’t be war. The EU can’t let it happen.
[23/02/2022, 18:37:48] Kabum: They already passed some sanctions against Russia and there’s more in line
[23/02/2022, 18:48:56] Richard: Sanctions on who?
[23/02/2022, 18:54:43] Kabum: Russia for sending troops into Ukraine
[23/02/2022, 18:55:11] Richard: Russia doesn’t fear sanctions
[23/02/2022, 18:55:33] Richard: And the US doesn’t fear bombing them if they keep what they are doing
[23/02/2022, 18:56:54] Kabum: The last that will happen now is war
[23/02/2022, 18:59:47] Kabum: EU cant let it Happen bse its still battling the dip of corona and its effects
[23/02/2022, 19:00:09] Richard: EU is not the king of the world
[23/02/2022, 19:05:51] Champ Matt US: I said before, once Bidens becomes president wars will resume
