I request for your help if possible. My dears, I wanted  to rent a bigger house so I get to this Ugandan site called Jiji I think it was the former OLX and I was excited they had a variety of houses in different areas so I get to this beautiful house that I liked then contacted the person he seemed nice he actually identified himself as Katende a broker and the number he used was 0757345119,  we later made an appointment to go and check on the premise, he told us the Owner is a doctor who stays in Mengo and the house was located in Munyonyo a very beautiful stand alone, We (me and my partner ) went to check out the house we found it open and we met there a man I think this is the keeper and there was another man who identified himself as the son to the owner and he is the estate’s manager all seemed well and we really liked it, therefore like any other person if your interested then you would start asking for the owners contact which was given to us by Katende the broker we then called the owner who identified himself as a Doctor from Mulago and Case clinic on number 0706525133 we went ahead and talked he really seemed so reasonable and he was articulate he sounded like a gentleman and told us a lot of staff that he gained our trust, the house was at 1,500,000shs (1.5m) we negotiated and he later reduced to 1,200,000shs (1.2m) but we should pay for 6 six months and told us that there was someone else that had liked the house so whoever pays first that’s the person he will give it to. 
I had fallen for the house and now started putting my partner on pressure to raise the money and since we had just come from the festivals it was tough, so he managed to raise 4,000,000 million shs (4m) and promised to pay the remaining 3,200,000 million shs (3m) the next week which he agreed upon. After getting the money we called Doctor who told us that he had gone to hospital to attend to his clients but he referred us to his son on number 0770850262 who is his estates manager remember we had met at the premise we then went ahead and signed a tenants agreement and all seemed well, we didn’t get the keys immediately because there were some few things on the house that we had agreed he had to first work on. We later parted ways.
Later during day we had some inquires to make we tried calling their phones and to our surprise all phones were switched off that’s when we realized we had been conned, honestly I was bewildered because I just couldn’t believe this had happened they all seemed nice, everything seemed real and as am writing the phones are still switched off or maybe I might have been blacklisted since it’s their business to go conning people around.
I took the so-called Son’s photo which I have since he’s the one that we gave the money to and because he claimed he didn’t have his Identification. And I also have the tenants agreement and receipt if anyone out there is able to help please assist us get these Crooks and I advise people there not to trust these online brokers especially from Jiji am told most of them are crooks please be careful I thought they were genuine people and they just wanted to by to.
Thank you all for your assistance.

Bryo jogs, Yusuf walks, isaac jogs, muhia runs  ..ask them how much they are willing to spend to ? 
Gym 
Jona used to go to gym, Yusuf goes to show off in the gym, man of steel  is a regular,  kaaya has gym membership not sure if you can consider him , byaleero uses jeans in the gym 
Ask them how much for gym kit ?

In summary
Running shoes less than 80k
Nice smart watches less 150k 
Gym shoes less 100k
Etc

[31/01/2020, 09:20:25] Brian M @: *103 passengers and only 40 meals was loaded on a Bombay to USA flight*.

The airline had bungled, and the crew was in a fix. However, one smart flight attendant had an idea.

About 30 minutes into the flight she nervously announced :
"I don't know how this happened but we have 103 passengers and only 40 dinners."

"Anyone who is kind enough to give up his/her meal for someone else, will receive free unlimited liquor during  the entire duration of the flight."

Her next announcement came two hours later :
*"If anyone wants to change their minds we still have 40 meals available*

Cheers !!!

*Moral*

People who drink have a big heart!!

It is a well established fact that we of the Najera-Kira-Biwaate-Kiwologoma-Kitukutwe axis eke out an existence in the rectum of Kampala (rumour has it that Mbalwa is the anus).

Yes we have the billowing dust and river-roads of Kira-Kasangati, the lunar surface excuses of feeder paths...and the sharp edged potholes awo ku Nexus, PK and Match and Mix - maama nyabo!
Not forgetting about 30% of the dwellings mid swamp.
........but nothing beats the now permanent snarl-ups at every turn. Jeez!

Previously this was pronounced during specific times e.g the morning/evening rush hours and Saturday mid mornings when everyone went out shopping but we had our bu exit/entry windows in between and happily moved along.
However lately it doesn't matter whether it is morning or evening rush hour, school or holiday time, whether bagundi are in or out - it is choc-a-bloc 24/7. I think the only place in the world where there is a traffic jam at 3:30am is Nexus - and the problem with this one is, its a mixture of drunk and tired types and even thieves exiting crime scenes.

That said, rather than sit and vent, we have all come up with several ways to counter this reality - some ingenious and others downright stupid like the retards that have gone the lead car/blaring sirens way. Attempting to beat the jam this way is not unlike trying to cure diarrhoea by blocking the anus (my all time favourite analogy) or treating flu with chloroquine.
Apart from ambulances, the presidential convoy and a couple of others, I am still struggling to understand why every Tom Dick and Harry Sagara must claim the right of way...even OO - riyalle!
You should meet The Governor's motorcade in Kololo - aibambe! They can finish you on the spot!

These days everyone from ministers, judges, minor police officers and civil servants to the Bafere of Bunga; everyone's a VIP - even Bebe Cool who, along Kigoowa road the other day, almost stepped on me and my lowly Pulimo as he manoeuvred his humongous dazzling numberless paid-for 4,500cc guzzler in lane 3 - also known as retard lane!
As long as you have a 4WD preferably with govt number plates or flashing lights in the radiator (common with the fake mineral merchants of Gaba road) then you are good to go. You can throw in a black-clad police zombie for oomph!

The winners are the Generals. Ho! First of all I don't know what they are doing outside the barracks ushering out our peace...which they ushered in, ironically?
These guys have motorcades and a half! Credit to their overall boss Davie, that even with his motorcade politely goes about his way.
Henewe back to the point, there's usually one or two box shape shiny green Landcruiser laden with kabuuti clad zinjathropus. These fuckers will poke your eyes if you even think of attempting to blink in their direction. Man, when those chaps drive up alongside me, I concentrate on the radio even attempting to get Capital Radio when my radio ends on 90 fa ma.
Kyo! General yaba General!

Still hot on our abnormally short collective memory is the drama of the savagery exhibited by a certain typhoon (yes, typhoon because tycoons are ordinarily cultured types) in a certain upscale neighbourhood?
It was an Afande Obbina vs Afande Rubunu scenario thus easily defused or defusable!

....but woe upon us when Afande Rubunu collides with Afande Rubunu in the traffic jam. There might even be a coup!

Good morning.

[11/02/2020, 16:03:22] Luckson S.A @: Once a Lawyer was travelling by train from *Liverpool to Manchester*.

When the train started, he realized he was traveling alone in the business class. A few minutes later, *a beautiful lady* came and sat in the opposite seat!

The lady kept smiling at him and eventually she sat next to him .... *the lawyer* kept bubbling with Joy.

She then leaned towards him and *whispered* in his ear ... _"Hand over all your cash, cards and mobile phone to me, else I will shout loudly and tell everybody that you are harassing and misbehaving with me"_ . The Lawyer stared blankly at her!!🙄

He took out a paper and a pen from his bag and wrote " _I am sorry, I can not hear or speak ... Please write on this paper whatever you want to say_"

The lady wrote everything that she had said earlier and gave it back to him!

The Lawyer took her note, kept it nicely in his pocket ... got up and told her in clear tones ...
*" _Now SHOUT & SCREAM!!!_ "*

Moral of the story:

*DOCUMENTATION IS VERY IMPORTANT*😜

_If you don't know how to get your dealings documented, you better learn this in 2020. Once your transaction is documented the Law of evidence vindicates you._

Free legal advice for you.

[17/02/2020, 14:03:32] Luckson S.A @: KEYNOTES FROM 2020 MEN'S CONFERENCE.

 1. "Never ever leave the woman who struggled with you for a slay queen." It's a stupid man can leave his kids and wife for a flesh peddler

 2. No giving money to a woman other than your lawful wife,or engaged or confirmed girlfriend,sister,mother or cousin."

 3. Lay down your standards and look for a woman who can fit or meet those standards.No wasting time on dates.State your case and be frank.If she can't meet those standards find the person that will

4.Sex is for both,No one should bare the responsibility of making the other "cum" don't keep pimping a frustrated woman not keen on catching up

5. Men are not poverty eradicators, don't marry a woman who brings all their problems to your home, school fees for siblings, medical bills for her parents, mara footing recurrent bills .marry a lady who will add  wealth to your life.

6. Avoid single mothers and divorcees like a caronavirus. Most of them are too bitter for life. vengeful and are ladened with garbages from previous failed relationships.

7. Don't marry or date for sympathy!!  Sex is not a scorecard for marriage neither is a child a passport for marriage!! Marry a lady you love not coz of circumstances. If DNA test  confirms the paternity, then you can support the child.

8. Never own or apologize even in the presence of glaring evidence!! That will be a weak point to be used in future to manipulate you. You can blame it on Satan but don't ever apologize.

9.some questions asked by ladies or wives don't have answers. Don't struggle to answer them!! Relax maintain your composure or just ignore them. Some of those questions will test your reaction, heartbeat or attitude. You will be convicted without trial.

10. Don't pay for a slay queen rent... Pay rent for the house you spend in every night. You are not Chinese government to bail out financial crippled bimbos...

[28/02/2020, 02:55:10] Brian M @: Cycling is bad for the Economy

Hilarious but true too 😄  Sanjay Thakrar, CEO at Euro Exim Bank Ltd.  got economists thinking when he said :  
A cyclist is a disaster for the country's economy  - He does not buy the car & does not take car loan  - Does not buy car insurance  - Does not buy Fuel  - Does not send his car for servicing & repairs  - Does not use paid Parking  - Does not become Obese  - Yes,.....and well, damn it !!  Healthy people are not needed for economy. They do not buy drugs. They do not go to Hospitals & Doctors.  They add nothing to country's GDP.  On the contrary, every new McDonald outlet creates at least 30 jobs - 10 Cardiologists, 10 Dentists, 10 weight loss experts apart from people working in McDonald outlet.  Choose wisely: A Cyclist or a McDonald ?   Worth thinking. 🤔🤔😀😀

PS. Those walking are even worse, they do not even buy a bicycle.🤔

[24/03/2020, 06:27:13] Fred Chomi @: Belgium Health minister has put a ban on all sexual activities of three people or more after a coronavirus party last week turned into a 500-participant orgy and ended with 380 cases of contamination.

“Wife swapping, threesomes, and orgies of six, fifty, one hundred or more are not permitted until the outbreak settles down,” she announced in Parliament.

Health minister De Block did not ban single or two-person sexual practices such as masturbation, anal or oral sex, or even bestiality.

[28/03/2020, 16:50:19] Bukenya Ronald @: Update on Hoima Case.

He was 55yrs,  aresident of Kibugubya, Kyabigambire scty, Hoima district. He was working in Afhaganistan. 

He jetted in from Afhaganistan on 17th march, he came straight to Hoima, he freely interacted with people, intelligence report say, from that time he dated six ladies, travelled to kla and back to Hoima three times using taxis. After developing symptoms,  he went back to mulago for testing, he never waited for results, came back and mixed up with pple freely. 

After results were out and one person among the 4 cases that had tested positive realised was from Hoima, the minister communcated to RDC and immiditely the team started the search not until he was got from one of the guest houses (names withheld) where he had slept with another woman. He was brought to Hoima RRH mental unit and MOH sent aspecial ambulance to evacuate him to Mulago for further management. The Hoima case is indeed acomplicated one, because he mixed freely with a lot of people, we therefore need to be so vigilant as we follow the set guidelines as well as praying for divine super natural powers to intervene and save us.

According to RDC Kisembo Araali, while appearing on atalkshow "Akatuti Kobugabe" on Radio Hoima this morning, he said the patient's 19 friends whom he has been interacting with have been identified, that 15 of them have been contacted and their blood samples are going to be tested today. The patient failed to cooperate with surveilance team to reveal the people he has been in contact with.

The situation is really bad, the number of cases are likely to increase in Hoima. We need to call divine super natural powers from God to safe us.

Please dear brothers and sisters,  wash your hands as many times as you possibly can, don't touch your eyes,nose and keep 4 metres away from anyone,no shaking hands, cover your nose & mouth then together,  we can stop the spread of this invisible killer Coronavirus.

*Dear Members*

The Doctor who recovered from Corona illness and recovered in double quick time had *inhaled Steam.*
The doctors at IDH Corona centre too are continuously  inhaling steam few times a day.

*Steaming raises the temperature of lungs, throat and mouth so that if the virus is already there it gets inactivated due to high temperature.*

Yes that’s true as viruses sit in the throat first. 

That’s why even if there is someone sneezing in your office or surroundings and you come home and *inhale steam and gargle with warm water and salt* usually you will not get the flu. 

We recommend for everyone who is able to do it - 
1. Use steam inhalation everyday - morning and evening if possible,
2. Gargle with warm water and salt daily - morning and evening if possible.

This is a good daily practice which will improve your overall well-being and can be continued even after COVID19 ends.

Please also pass this information for the benefit of others.

[01/04/2020, 00:48:05] Brian M @: “Suddenly”

Suddenly, we slept in one world and woke up in another. Disney has no more magic and Paris is no longer romantic.

Suddenly, in New York everyone sleeps. And the Great Wall of China is no longer a fortress.

Suddenly, hugs and kisses become weapons. Holding hands and walking the parks become outlawed. 

Suddenly, not visiting aging parents and grandparents becomes an “act of love”.

Suddenly, our bombs and machine guns, our tanks and artilleries begin to gather dust. 

Suddenly, we realized that power is with God alone. And that money has no value when it can’t even buy you toilet paper.

Suddenly, we have been put back in our place by the hands of the universe. 

And we’ve been made aware how vulnerably “human” we truly are, when faced with a microbe so powerfully inhumane. 

Stay safe 🙏🏻

2. Millionaires have gate men instead of electric gates.
3. Females wake up with earings and make-up in the morning.
4. When Patience Ozokor wants to poison someone she first tastes the poison but never dies.
5. They cut grass with a panga instead of a slasher.
6. 20years later in the movie but the family dog is still alive.
7. A ghost looks both sides before crossing the road.
8. People always ask for a menu at restaurants but end up ordering rice and chicken.
9. No matter how low your TV volume is, the movie will always make a huge soundooo!!!🔊

Bosses that are always asking their house helps where all the food has gone, I think you now know. 

In this Lockdown most of you are now helping out with house  chores.After Cleaning the windows,you eat 5 slices of bread 😂😂.

After doing your laundry ,you settle down and gobble 5 boiled eggs😂.

After burning rubbish, you guzzle 2litres of juice 😂😂.......

After taking a nap, you eat all the 10 pieces of grilled chicken😛🙄😂. 

Kwegamba just taking the plate to the kitchen is also work ,you end up eating  a 3kg Watermelon😂😂😂😂.

[06/04/2020, 19:15:26] Mugerwa Alvin @: Hehe
[06/04/2020, 20:15:51] Luckson S.A @: Does 5G cause Coronavirus? Short answer is no. Long answer is as follows.

Myth 1: Wuhan was the first place in the world to get 5G in October last year, hence they were the first to get the new Coronavirus in November last year. 

FALSE. South Korea was the first to get 5G in April last year. They did not have their first Covid case until 20 Jan this year. USA was the second country to get 5G in April also last year and they didn't have their first case until 20 Jan.Germany was the third country to get 5G in June last year and their first case wasn't until 27 Jan this year. China got 5G in October last year and Wuhan was only one of several cities in China to get 5G around this time. The COVID disease originated in Wuhan in November last year and the spread of the virus can be clearly tracked. If 5G was the cause, then we should see Covid cases appearing in the order that 5G was introduced. This is NOT the case, so there is NO temporal (time) association between 5G and Covid. 

Myth 2: Covid only affects the countries that have 5G. 

FALSE. There are 34 countries in the world with 5G networks. There are now 201 countries in the world with Covid cases. Iran is an example of a country where there is no 5G with a lot of Covid cases (45,000). So there is NO geographical association between 5G and Covid. 

Myth 3: Countries with more 5G towers have more cases of Covid. 

FALSE. South Korea has the highest number of cities (85) with 5G availability, yet their Covid outbreak is well controlled. This can be attributed to their aggressive early testing. USA on the other hand is a much larger country than Korea yet only has 50 cities with 5G availability, and their Covid outbreak is now the largest in the world. This can be attributed to poor management. So there is NO dose-response relationship between Covid and 5G. 

Myth 4: Viruses are made by poisoned cells in order to get rid of toxic waste products. Viruses are not harmful and not infectious. 

FALSE. Please uppercut yourself if you believe this. Viruses are infectious particles that attach to and invade cells in order to take over the cell machinery. They then use the cell machinery to create more copies of themselves which infect other cells in the vicinity. In this process, the cell is damaged and can die, leading to inflammation and an immune response (release of cytokines including interferons, TNF-alpha and interleukins). This immune response is actually what causes symptoms of infection, such as fever, fatigue, headaches, and muscle aches, not the virus infection itself. This is why patients with a severely compromised immune system may not have a fever even though they have a severe infection. This is also why you may experience symptoms similar to the flu after a flu vaccine, because the immune response is being stimulated. Viruses have been studied extensively for the last 100 years and you can actually observe cells changing and dying in response to a viral infection through a microscope. 

Myth 5: 5G radiation causes symptoms similar to Covid illness (shortness of breath and headache) because 60GHz radiation is absorbed by molecular oxygen and impairs binding of oxygen to haemoglobin (protein that binds oxygen in blood).

FALSE. There are no 5G networks that use 60GHz frequency at this time. Most networks are using frequencies around 3.5GHz, with gradually increasing usage of higher frequencies in the 28GHz range. It is true that 60GHz photons are absorbed by oxygen (O2) molecules, because that is one of the frequencies that can cause a change in the rotational state of oxygen in the gas phase. However, this is also the reason that the 60GHz frequency is NOT being used by any network at this time, because the signal is rapidly lost in only a short distance. There are theoretical benefits to 60GHz frequency use, which include less interference and increased ability to re-use frequencies which is why there are discussions about this frequency online. Even if 60GHz was being used, the change in the rotational state of oxygen would only be observed for a fraction of a second, as the energy would quickly be dissipated into the surrounding air. In addition, only one out of trillions and trillions of oxygen molecules in the air would be affected by this. So there is NO plausible biological mechanism for 5G causing symptoms similar to Covid. 

Myth 6: Ok ok, maybe 5G doesn't cause Coronavirus, but it is still harmful to our health. 

MAYBE but probably not. Both 5G and visible light are made up of photons. 5G technology uses frequencies up to 95GHz. Visible light is made up of photons that have a frequency 10,000 times higher (400-800THz), and so the energy per photon is a corresponding 10,000 times higher. Even the energy per photon in visible light is much lower than the energy required to knock electrons off atoms (ionization). In addition, we are exposed to a tremendous amount of visible light radiation (along with infrared and UV radiation) everyday from the sun, which is millions, if not billions, of times higher than any radiation that we would receive from 5G technology. Therefore I do not see how 5G radiation could be any more harmful to our health than infrared radiation or visible radiation, which we are exposed to in much larger amounts. The studies on radiofrequency radiation is conflicting, with the majority finding no association between exposure and cancer, but there are a few studies that show a small association. The studies that showed these associations are not well-designed and have flaws in their methods that make me skeptical of the results. Based on the current evidence, radiofrequency radiation is classed as a Group 2B carcinogen (possibly causes cancer in humans). Kava extract and aloe vera extract are also Group 2B carcinogens. That being said, I cannot say for certain that prolonged low-level exposure to radiofrequency or microwavefrequency is not harmful to health. Even if it was, the effect is likely to be extremely minimal (far less than the effect of processed meats or alcohol). 

In the end, we are all exposed to lots of different carcinogens in our life. Some we can avoid and some we can't (such as sunlight). Alcohol and processed meats are both Group 1 carcinogens (KNOWN to cause cancer in humans) yet I still enjoy both of these things from time to time. For me, the very real benefits from 5G far outweigh the very miniscule risk from 5G that may not even exist.

_For the benefit of all, I am sharing my perspective on such scenario on few aspects as below:_

_*What will change during the slow down:*_

_1. Spend on luxury will come down drastically_

_2. Long-term / Capital expenditure such as construction, technology will be almost cut to nil_

_3. Lifestyle expenditure such as salary, rent, infrastructure, entertainment will be minimised_

_4. Working capital will be under tremendous pressure. Businesses will go out of business especially those who are riding on borrowed working capital_

_5. New innovative business models will evolve_

_*What will NOT change during the slow down:*_

_1. People consumption on essentials will continue_

_2. Rise in Investment on ideas / technology solutions that will improve efficiency_ 

_3. Short-term trading businesses with healthy cash flow practices will thrive_

_4. Rise in investment on spiritual / self-learning practices_

_5. Value for money products / services will shine_

_*What you should do as an individual:*_

_1. Hold back any luxury / high risk investments where visibility of returns is difficult to predict_

_2. Minimise expenditure on the routine stuff - keep a watch on your lifestyle spend - ask the question, is it really necessary!_

_3. Develop yourself on improving competency and developing skills to become more sharper and efficient_

_4. Share the financial situation with your family members and educate them on the family financial position and the plans to improve_

_5. Invest - yes invest on the right things. History repeats. Take risks based on thorough research. This is not the time to follow tips._

_*What you should do as an Entrepreneur:*_

_1. Take care of your employees - communicate more than ever. Be reasonable and transparent with them_

_2. Use the slow down to improve your processes / people_

_3. Invest in technology / systems that will accelerate your reach in adding value to your customers_

_4. Be frugal in working capital decisions and operating expenditure_

_5. Capital expenditure to be on hold unless there is clear visibility on the associated returns_

_Let us get smarter by helping ourselves and economy to bounce back stronger._

_The planning for the coming foreseeable .🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥_

[10/04/2020, 13:47:58] Isaac Senkandwa @: 1. The President was clear, at the end of his Address, that he hadn't read the full list - that's why he didn't mention the money donated by the Kabaka of Buganda or the Coca-Cola contribution. 
2. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa contributed 30 cartons of Rwenzori Water for the Mandatory Quarantine Centres on the first day they were set up as it was an emergency and people were up in arms about being quarantined. 
3. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa also contributed the 187 jerrycans for emergency handwashing stations at the border points in the first week - given to the Directorate of Immigration and Citizenship Control. This was to begin controlling the possible spread of COVID-19 through border points.
4. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa has contributed US$22,300 for the first phase of the fight.
5. This is only the first phase so everybody should brace themselves for a lot more to come.

POST COVID19 ERA: A HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT JOB SECURITY

You will find a number of employers who genuinely want to save jobs. You will also find those who are pressed on the wall and can’t keep every job – for a while. 

You might have a job after this. But if it won’t be there, it shouldn’t come as a shock. That is why I am writing this article. To open your eyes.
 
My goal is so that you draw from this knowledge, analyze your own situation and make some conclusions or adjustments. I don’t intend to give you answers because every situation is different and unique. That requires a personalized discussion. 

But first, here are some strong points to note:

POINT 1: Never ever think that you cannot lose your job

POINT 2: The #1 priority of any CEO is the survival of the Organization not individuals

POINT 3: Organizations are not established to offer jobs. Otherwise, they’d have converted their profits into salaries just to hire that extra person.

That said, I want you to ask yourself these questions – and I give reasons why you should ponder about them. 

#1. How does this organization I work for make money? Where does its money come from? What does it do to get the money?

If your answer was ‘from Donors’, ask yourself, how do the donors get the money they donate? 

If your answer was ‘we sell services and/or products’, think about the people who purchase those services and products. If you were the client, would the services/products your organization sells be priority to you after Covid19? If no, then revenues might reduce and that often affects jobs sometimes. Keep you ears and eyes open to how things will play out in those first months after Covid19.

The organization is your number one customer now. When something changes in the world of the customer, you ought to change too if you are to stay relevant.

#2. When my organization was asked to choose the most crucial people to camp at the office for 14 days, why wasn’t I chosen? And it might not mean anything in the end. It could be that if they had a choice, they wouldn’t have let anyone work away from office. But why aren’t you among the crucial ones? Shouldn’t you be? Why are you not?

#3. Working from home. How much interruptions are you getting from work? Do you feel a sense that you did not leave office? You might have been working on a construction site and everything closed. But for some people, it feels like Christmas break where they disengage completely from work even when their organizations are open for business. 

Remember, organizations were forced to make tough choices. They wished they could keep working and some are still working underground/on internet. It is worth asking yourself why, in this transition to working virtually, it feels as if you are on a holiday?

Before I conclude, I feel obliged to share how you can position yourself. In every crisis, there is an opportunity. I don’t want you to miss it.

#1. The first place to start from are entitlements. What can you sacrifice on your side to contribute to the organization’s survival? Declare it. Avoid being an expense. Salary isn’t an entitlement. It is an obligation. Look at things like bonuses, transport, lunch… It could also be that you actually don’t have to forfeit them. Just make better judgment.

#2. You should already be keeping your manager’s or employer’s phone busy inquiring on the urgent issues you could be addressing while #StayingAtHome. Be of help. In a crisis, prepare to fit in any role, including selling if you are not in sales.

#3. Volunteer to make some research that might come in handy for the organization during this time or after. It could be opportunities or you might want to look in areas the organization might not be looking. I implore you to stay in your lane as you do this. Don’t go volunteering in other people’s job jurisdictions.

#4. Listen, Listen and Listen some more. A lot of things are going to be said. Some are already being said. Listen. Listen to the body language. Listen to the feeling behind the words. Your role is to lessen your manager’s or employer’s troubles. And you can only know if you listen.

Dear employee, it is no longer an option that the issues of your employer aren’t your concern. The employer’s issues are the reason why someone will lose or have their job. So, concern yourself, in a genuine way, with the employer’s issues right now.

*THE BIG PICTURE IN LOCKDOWN* 

In as much as COVID19 pandemic is regrettable by what it portends for inclement times , I also want to say it can also be a blessing in disguise.

Brainstorming with a friend, we came to the conclusion that this is the best time to ask ourselves serious questions so as to reinvent oneself.

If you have been working for a company for more than 5yrs and you don't have 100k savings ... *You need to think* 

If you have been doing a particular hustle for more than 5yrs and notting to show for it.. *You need to think.* 

If you've spent one month at home under Lockdown drawing from your reserves without cash inflows from other sources......
*YOU NEED TO THINK.*

IF You've spent 30 days at home browsing the internet, responding to greetings in Facebook, looking up pictures in Instagram, watching YouTube videos, responding to WhatsApp chats, calling everyone and nobody is calling you.... .
*YOU NEED TO THINK.*

IF you've spent 30 days at home eating delicacies,drinking choice wine, sleeping, watching movies and exercising  in your gym without reading a word from any book.....
*YOU NEED TO THINK*

*30 days Lockdown means 720 idle hours.

*720 idle hours translates to 43,200 minutes of idle time.

*8 Man hours worktime per day translates to 240 hours lost time or capacity under utilization or inefficiency index.

Life has given us almost a month to think about ourself and come out with a Grand Strategy and productive plan to stem the tide.

What we are facing now is almost the same thing retirees face when they retire and even worse.

One thing to note for sure is that, at the end of this pandemic, many businesses will suffer severe setbacks and new ones will emerge out of thick skin.

Start-Ups will swallow SMEs, Digital media will bury traditional media, Artificial Intelligence will take out unskilled labour.
 
Billionaires will feel the heat and new ones will need longer time to emerge.

So, ask yourself, which side will I belong to when this Lockdown is over?

Meanwhile, as we speak, most companies are also typing their own *redundancy* letters to be distributed .

Don't spend your time waiting for *COVID-19* daily statistics and doing all manner of social media challenge.

 *SIT AT HOME . LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE, THINK.   STRATEGIZE   and COME OUT STRONGER*

*Schools in USA and UK are not shutdown but reverted to online academics.

*The financial services sector(Wall street NASDAQ)in USA and UK are not shutdown but trading online.

*Certified online courses are not shutdown but running unimpeded.

It is only in the third world that the Lockdown is considered holidays without electricity, ventilators,test kits and face masks.

The Game Changers after the Lockdown are:

*Smart Thinkers.
*Multi super skill innovators.
*Creative inventors.
*Ideas Merchants.
*Cost reduction strategists.
*Market share readers.
*Competition induced drivers.

These boils down to the search for "HOT BRAINS" or High Level Human Capacity index cases for Strategic Turnarounds and Corporate rebound.

*WHAT TO DO?*

*Think diversification.
*Think Advisory Consultancy.
*Think Capacity building.
*Think Technology
*Think Skills set innovation.
*Think Artificial intelligence forex trading
* Think Income multiplication
*Think of moving to the right side of the Quadrant

TIME, TASK AND TIDE DEFINES STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT.

LET'S TALK OMEGAPRO
LET'S GIVE IT THE PUSH
LETS HELP DESTINY

Have a beautiful night rest.

[18/04/2020, 08:33:18] Byalero Ronald @: Thing we have learnt during Corona.
1. Uganda can work without MPs. Infact we are better off without them.
2. Uganda doesn't need a vice president.
3. Pastors and prophets never actually healed anyone.
4. Only Pastors worth your tithe are Kayanja, Bujingo (Atleast they bring back what they stole)
5. Nssf money is yours after you die
6. Boda Boda is more important
7. Men need the side chicks so they are not mean to their wives.
8. Ofuna entondo when you spend alot of hours home. U start seeing your woman's mistakes easily.
9. Women don't actually like u to over stay home.
10. Museveni is the only president in the country
11. Rambo, Superman and all the movie heroes are not real heroes.
12. It's not possible to have sex everyday. More than two rounds everyday are for excited youths.
13. You are just lazy. There's alot you can do at home.
14. Men can cook
15. Everyone can survive with junk food or alcohol.
16. Your side chick can survive on her own.
17. Your kids and family need you to stop wasting money in a bar or yowa kampwankyi. That money can just save u alot.
18. Everyone needs to reserve money or have an Emmergency account.
19. Rema's relationship and Bebe Cool Bobi Wine feud were non of your business. You just abused and hated people on behalf of people who don't know u. Non of that has brought food to your table. Wasted data and useless hate.
20. Tomatoes are expensive
21. The English language is poor .
There's no snizing in and snizing out (okwetyamula)
22. The vulnerable poor mean people who stay in town not villages.

[18/04/2020, 15:48:45] Baguma Robert @: *Brilliant comment on the US Economy!*

Dr. Marc Faber, the investment guru, concluded his monthly bulletin with the following comments! :
 
The federal government is sending each of us a *$600 rebate.*

If we spend that money at *Wal-Mart*, the money goes to *China.*
If we spend it on *gasoline* it goes to the *Arabs.*
If we buy a *software*, it will go to *India.*
If we purchase *fruits and vegetables* it will go to *Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala.*
If we purchase a *good car*, it will go to *Germany and Japan.*
If we purchase *useless crap*, it will go to *Taiwan or Korea.*
In short, *none of it* will help the *American economy.*

The *only way to keep that money here at home* is to spend it on *Guns, Prostitutes, and Beer*, since these are the *only products still produced in the US!* 😄🤣

[19/04/2020, 17:59:41] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Over 384 scientists signed an appeal from 2017 to stop 5G deployment
[19/04/2020, 17:59:44] Bukenya Ronald @: Listen carefully. It's not that it causes Corona. But it leads to cancer growth
[19/04/2020, 18:00:07] Brian M @: The world will clean itself again in 2120
[19/04/2020, 18:00:30] ‪+256 774 988974‬: I already knew this brother, the bit that caught me was the Barack Administration funded research to make this bloody thing

[19/04/2020, 18:08:48] Luckson S.A @: Never listen to conspiracy theories if your knowledge is limited. This is dangerous fake news.... just like those who become terrorists, they realise their blunter wen it's way too late
[19/04/2020, 18:17:23] ‪+256 774 988974‬: What is your recommendation on this . But there are multiple papers written on dangers of Millimeter waves which 5G uses
[19/04/2020, 18:18:08] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Should we go with the research and approvals done in the 80s and 90s for a technology which is a few years old
[19/04/2020, 18:21:11] Luckson S.A @: Its unfortunate that reseaches r done by people with interest to the outcome. They sponsor university professors to do these researches. If they come to different conclusion they stop fundiing.  This reminds me of 80s consipiracy about hiv being in Cannes beans. Only later to realise HIV cant survive 4 seconds outside human body.. In 2 years or so some of these statements people make will be memes
[19/04/2020, 18:21:51] Luckson S.A @: The fill effect is still to be realised. Time is too short to tell right now
[19/04/2020, 18:22:09] Luckson S.A @: But masts have an effect on human and any species

[19/04/2020, 18:23:21] ‪+256 774 988974‬: But some studies have gone into Millimeter waves which existed before 5G

[20/04/2020, 19:49:26] Luckson S.A @: Men’s Testicles ‘Could Make Them More Vulnerable To Coronavirus’ – Doctors Reveals
opera.comApr 20, 2020 2:34 PM

A report by MedRxix indicates that studies have shown that the presence of testicles of men makes them more vulnerable to Coronavirus.

The report revealed that researchers in India did a study on 68 recovered patients in Mumbai on the gender disparity of the virus.

According to two doctors, Dr Aditi Shastri an oncologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and Dr Jayanthri Shastri at the Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Mumbai has revealed that the Coronavirus clings itself to a protein that occurs in high levels in the testicles.

Their study indicated that Coronavirus could remain in men’s testicles as the virus bonds with the protein in the body that are found in the lungs, intestines, heart and also the testicles giving credence to reason why the disease is more prevalent in men than women.

The study also showed that COVID-19 bonds with cells that express the ACE2 protein, or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is less prevalent in ovarian.

Dr. Aditi Shastri and Dr. Jayanthi Shastri in a statement said; “These observations demonstrate that male subjects have delayed viral clearance,”

‘High expression of ACE2 RNA and protein in testes leads to the hypothesis that testicular viral reservoirs may exist and play a role in viral persistence, and should be further investigated by larger clinical studies ” the authors wrote, adding that the testicles may be serving as reservoirs for the virus.

A Professor of Virology from the University of Reading, Ian Jones, also told Daily Mail: ‘Men generally do worse than women in immunological outcomes, possibly the result of only one X chromosome, and I think that this imbalance is more likely behind the differences seen.’

[09/05/2020, 22:26:12] ‪+256 782 025341‬: I attended a Webinar by IMF, this morning. Key takeaways are as follows.
 *General Outlook* 
1.Africa seems to be  supressing the curve so far. It looks like it might escape the worst of the pandemic, but will have to be cautious about it.
2.	Possibility of W Curve – i.e. There is a good chance of re-occurrence of the virus, which could see a possibility of regular lockdowns. Businesses need to plan accordingly.
3.	Capital will look for countries that are less battered. Western economies are badly battered while countries in Africa, etc are not so battered. Global Capital could flow there, if we can act efficiently to pull it.
4.	Emotional and Economic backlash against China is expected. Already, countries and companies are working on strategy to pivot away from China as part of their supply chains. Japan Govt has announced packages for it’s companies bringing back manufacturing home. Businesses need to keep this in mind and work accordingly.

*Discretionary Spending.*
1.	For individuals, health and safety will become No.1 on their agenda from the 3rd of 4th place. There will be more spending on this area and reduction in other discretionary spends.
2.	The ticket size of spending will drop for a while. People will spend on cheaper goods than on expensive goods, or delay spending for a while.
3.	Extreme acceleration in digital economy. I.e. Home education, home entertainment, home fitness, etc
4.	Loyalty shock. People will be less loyal towards brands as other aspects will take over. People will switch brands faster due to various other concerns like safety, etc.
5.	General Trust deficit. There will be trust deficit amongst stakeholders like vendors, customers, employees, borrowers, banks, etc. Banks will have trust deficit with borrowers, companies will have trust deficit with suppliers, etc.

*Liquidity and P&L*
1.	Segregate Good Costs and Bad Costs
a.	Good costs (Eg. Digitization, tech costs, digital marketing, best employees, etc) need to be insulated and protected
b.	Bad Costs (Eg. Fancy office, unnecessary spending, bad performers, traditional working methods) need to be ruthlessly eliminated. Don’t be emotional about non-core businesses. Concentrate on core business.
2.	Be Frugal – Not necessary to have fancy office, fancy cars, excess employee strength, etc. Remove all the flab and be lean.
3.	 Maintain Good behaviour – have frank and open conversation with all stakeholders like suppliers, employees, etc and try to find the middle ground, so that the burden can be shared justly.
4.	Be Future Ready – In this crisis, there will be winners and there will be losers. Those who re-orient their strategy will be winners.


*Govt Stimulus.*
1.	Economy was in poor shape even before Covid. The govt has little leeway to provide large stimulus.
2.	Govt earns alot from taxes, with losses experiences how will this be pushed up?
3.	Inequality has already sharpened. The gap between rich and poor has further increased. Govt needs to concentrate on mass health and mass welfare. If not, 40 million people could sink into poverty.
4.	Govt must explore printing currency (Quantitative easing), but there are limitations here. It has side effects like inflation, etc. Rich countries have more leeway for such quantitative easing.
5.	Govt must concentrate on grabbing more capital from outside and do reforms to enable that.

*Result of backlash against China*
1.	Internationally, there could be an emotional and economic backlash against China. 
2.	Businesses with supply chains passing through China will need to keep this in mind and insulate themselves and build alternatives.
3.	Africa and african businesses need to try to become the contract manufacturer of the world, just like China is. They  need to make use of this opportunity smartly.
4.	All big wealth funds and soverign funds will be awash with Liquidity. This liquidity needs to be attracted.
5.	In every sector, there are good and bad companies. Management has to invest correctly in manufacturing and modern tech, be honest and fair to all stakeholders, etc., Those companies with good management and displaying good behaviour will come out victorious.

*Export Business*
1.	African exporters need to build trust. They need live up to promises made. They need to deliver on time and deliver the promised quality. They shouldn’t make incorrect promises just to get more business.
2.	Asian export business has built trust and a good reputation. Despite a chequered past (low quality, human rights issues, etc) they have managed to overcome and are winning.

*Wholesale, Retail, etc.*
1.	More people will prefer to buy from retail stores where there is perception of safety (Eg. Sanitation, cleanliness, crowds, etc). They will move more towards malls away from markets. Many will move towards online stores. Wholesale suppliers also need to concentrate on such retailers. 
2.	Customers also need to be ringfenced:
a.	A high end restaurants need to give high percentage of bill value as  gift coupons to be used anytime upto December 2020.
b.	Car companies and mortgages shiuld give buy back offers, incase the customer loses his job in the next one year.
3.	Pricing needs to be re-approached. People are looking for cheaper prices or cheaper goods.

*Brick & Mortar in Discretionary Spends.*
1.	Private academies could take a big hit in the near future. Entertainment could move home.
2.	Because of this, cafes and restaurants might see some increase in business. Many chains are implementing measures like social distancing like lesser furniture, etc, to build confidence to consumers.
3.	Smaller retailers need to send a message of safety. Eg: Have sanitisers, put up notice of no Covid positive employee found in the store, maintain social distancing, etc.
4.	Since travel and tourism will take a big hit, connected purchases will also shift. Purchases that happened abroad will happen at home. (Eg. Electronics, Luxury goods and apparel, etc.,). But travel related purchases will drop.

*Financial Markets*
1.	There will be value destruction and value creation in different companies in the same sector.
2.	High Debt low margin companies will find it difficult. (indicates risky or unscrouplus management)
3.	High Debt high margin companies could be rewarded, but caution needs to be exercised. (may indicate sharp or dynamic management)
4.	No debt high margin companies are best rewarded now.
5.	Know more about the CEO and management and their actions and activities.
6.	New tech unicorns will be born. Those involved in cyber security, cloud services, online education services, etc.

*Forex Markets*
1.	No doomsday scenario (i.e. Dollar will keep on going up etc). Such scenarios don’t seem realistic
2.	Govt should be buying as much oil as possible, as such prices may never be seen in the future of oil.
3.	As the western economies are more battered and local economy is less battered so far, there is more liquidity coming in. That’s why there is a rally in the market. This scenario could change depending on the spread of the disease.
4.	Watch out for sharp spikes in the market. Better to avoid the spikes.

*Outlook for near future.*
*A.	Large Companies*
a.	Huge concern seen for employees. Companies are paying the employees even when closed. 
b.	Right sizing will happen
c.	Safety of employees and customers is becoming a major point of focus.
d.	This is possible because they have reserves of funds, etc that have been built up over the years.

*B.	Medium and Small businesses.*
a.	They have to work with thin capital reserves. Excess capital is taken out of the business and applied into personal assets.
b.	Small businesses take out the surplus and purchase personal assets instead of re-investing in the business. There are various factors and motivations here.
c.	Because of this, they are unable to meet the cash expenses of even the next month.
e.	Medium and Small business need to have a look at how they can build some business reserves to endure such disruptions.

*“Force Majeure” in Contracts*
1.	Should *force majeure* clauses be triggerd in various contracts like rent, supply, etc? It will lead to litigation, but there is no point in getting into litigation now.
2.	All parties have been affected by the crisis. The tenants, the landlords, the lenders/financiers, etc.
3.	Parties need to sit across the table and find a common ground and mutually decide upon the costs, rentals, etc. Burden has to be shared.

*Work From Home Scenario.*
1.	It is possible for lot of employees to not visit the office and still be productive.
2.	Telecoms and ISP will be singing Halleluyia to the banks
3.	Parents can take care of children more effectively . There can be dark hours when no calls will be made, etc., 

*Optimism*
As per a McKinsey survey of entrepreneurs released few days ago, 67% of African entrepreneurs are optimistic, 53%, while only 37% of Asian entrepreneurs are optimistic.
It seems to be a mild U-Curve for some African economies. But the descent has not stopped yet.

At one time when things are hard, you decide to get just 20 cows from the farm to share among the owners . The Farm Manager riots. He says that in the constitution of your farm you indicated that you would only get benefits from the enterprise only in old age. You remind him that the law allows the owners of the farm to amend any guidelines they made in the past. The Manager, who purely gets his salary from the proceeds of your farm, refuses to listen. He cries foul and writes to the authorities of the land claiming that his employers want to bring down their own farm by taking out 20 cows. He says that even the 80 cows the owners think will remain on the farm are actually not there in the real sense despite them giving birth to young ones every month. You remember that this same Manager has been giving away some cows from your farm to local chiefs as gifts and donations to different causes without your consent. You shake your head in confusion and wonder whose interests the Manager of your farm serves. This firm goes by the name NSSF Farm Limited.

NSSF’S LETTER TO THE MINISTER OF FINANCE,PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

Good afternoon Sir. Yesterday you asked for my opinion on the letter NSSF wrote to the Minister with regards to the Covid-19 relief for its members: Paying of 20% of each member’s balance.
I’m not sure if the minister also asked Management to indulge in the Macro economic impact of this “transaction” but I think that would be MoFPED and Central Bank to competently handle Macroeconomic policy and give the final position. NSSF manage should concern themselves with their primary strand of responsibility- providing social security to it’s members. 

There’s a school of thought on the theory of the half glass. Basically stating that the Optimistic mind (sighting opportunities and possibilities) sees the glass half full and the Pessimistic mind(seeing difficulties, impossibilities and challenges) will always see the same glass half empty! A quick scan of the document would suggest the Fund’s managers have decided to fall under the later, in order to discourage such a proposal from ever seeing the light of day. An optimistic Fund manager on the other hand would have used this opportunity to (“do what it says on the tin”) and entice/attract a bigger (including voluntary savers) membership to the Fund by demonstrating their relevance and usefulness to existing members at such a time when most governments are extending financial assistance to their vulnerable citizens in form of social welfare programs- I trust you have been following  at International level so I shall not belabour .......... 
Of course, the UGX 380 m that NSSF gave to the National Task Force efforts under the Prime Minister’s office was appreciated by the country at large but now it’s core members need NSSF support for some of their money to bail them out as they struggle to sustain their families and meet their day to day obligations.

The Fund management in citing dire negative economic consequences is stealthily and technically avoiding their natural responsibility - The purpose and cause on which NSSF was formed. Any systemic economic risk that was meant to happen due to the global pandemic, Covid-19, is happening right now and there’s nothing NSSF can do about it. This risk is already crystallising in the Ugandan market and every player in the market will feel its heat! So whatever must go wrong is going wrong as we speak. However, the non- systematic risk anticipated by the Fund managers prior to Covid- 19 can be hedged by simple instruments going forward. For example if the treasury desk officers finds that their asset interest rates are falling, they can acquire a liability whose interest rate will offset any loss on that asset. There are simple Zero cost financial instruments being offered by banks in our market like Stanbic, Stanchart, Equity and the like. I’m fully aware that the Fund has got a risk management framework, that takes into account scenarios and simulations like “a run on the Fund” and any competent crisis management plans would have been put in place to cater for such contingencies as standard procedure for any given financial or quasi financial institutions in this market. 

So the net Cash of  UGX 2.5 Trillion needed within the next one year (12 months) to fulfil this obligation, boils down to affordability, without any political innuendo or undertones. 

Going by the content of the letter you shared and their last published Financial statements of Financial Y/E June 2018/19, my unbiased/unprejudiced thoughts are as follows:-

In order for NSSF to fulfil the liquidity needs of 20% of member balances alluded to, they would need to look at their liquidity position. First the UGX 125 Bn tacked away in reserves for a rainy day; it’s raining now! Secondly, the Current assets at about UGX 280 Bns are immediately available if they chose to operate an Accident and Emergency system - it attends to the most fatal not who came first or who is more important. Like a case by case basis. Secondly, those Government Securities held by the Government of Kenya that are over a UGX 1 Trillion! In a nutshell, this is Ugandan saver’s money being used to build Kenyan infrastructure, and this is okay! Thirdly, a phased liquidation of their treasury bills, bonds and Fixed deposits within the Ugandan market. This assured fixed income albeit with different maturity tenures falling under 3 - months, 6- months, 1- year, 5 years, 10- years, etc.They would have dive in and look at these assets concurrently with the monthly contributions they collect from members. These assets never have the same maturity times. This asset class accounts for over 70% of the whole investment portfolio of NSSF so a phased transaction can be used to cushion any negative effects anticipated on this asset class alone without needing to  touch the real Estate and Equities classes. The payments required for the fulfilment of the contractual obligations under the real estate contracts ( which contracts normally span over 5-years plus, are already planned for and fall under business as usual. Management is not required to pay 100% of these obligations upfront in one year and each contract has pre-negotiated terms in case of delayed payments. Never mind that an average NSSF saver will not be able to afford those houses for example in Lubowa. You heard right, 75% of the Fund is owned by 100K members (who are 4% of members) who probably already own homes anyway. This lot may not even need their 20% at this time. The Fund collects UGX 100 bn cash from savers every month and only approximately 3% of this goes to paying monthly benefit claims to members. The rest of the cash can also be added on the 20% settlement. 

There’s an artificially amplified impact on the Ugandan economy. Uganda’s GDP alone without crossing to the rest of East Africa is currently USD 27.46 Bn (UGX 92.7 Trn). The UGX 2.5Tr (20%) is a mere 3% of this but would still be spent and re-invested within the economy by its members without significant economic leakages. This is still a boost in the economy because more money in circulation to buy goods in the market. The impact of this pay out on exports as NSSF suggests is decimal because no one knows for sure how much of that money once paid,  would be channeled towards exports, sufficient enough to cause an impairment on our Balance of Trade/Payments position as a country. Uganda’s economy is said to be growing at 6% p.a. Core inflation is currently running at 3.4 % and with all the projected doom as a result from Covid -19; is projected to stand at 4.6% in 2021! A difference of only 1.2%. Uganda has in addition along all the other EA countries got a lot of external budgetary support coming to a total of UGX 3.2 Trn. The total effect of all this should be enough to mitigate any shock in the market resulting from a cash outflow of UGX 2.5 Trn. It should be mentioned that most of this money is coming in as the much needed USD and EUROs forex. The spokes person for Bank of Uganda and MoFPED must throw more light on this aspect.

From a human perspective alone, when I weigh the cost of defaulting on a real estate project, the so called “damage” to the east African securities markets, the sell of securities at a discount against the UGX 2.5Tr ( 3% of GDP) and the Financial reporting implications alluded to by the Fund’s management AGAINST the need to bail out Fund members with a small amount of their own hard earned savings needed to survive, I feel the very purpose of the Fund’s existence has been obliterated the inept mindset of the Fund’s management that’s contingent on chance survival and smoke screens!

The citation of Jamwa’s case totally has no place in this debate. I’m not a lawyer but as you know, ignorance of the law has never been a defence. This precedent has been misinterpreted in this case and misapplied. Every situation is unique and carries unique merits, context and circumstances. If the Fund’s managers in this case chose to exit a financial position on any securities in the market prior to Maturity to acquire liquidity in order to save lives, the courts of law would apply the Spirit of the law and not literally or mischievously interpret the law to lock them up! A legal opinion can be officially sought by NSSF from the Attorney General’s office or even from their own external lawyers! You can further consult your legal associates on this.
The Legal aspects of concern to be revisited is the aspect of retaining reserves from the annual profits made. All remaining profits after costs are supposed to be distributed.The law only allows the Fund managers to remove their operating costs and distribute the rest to the members whose money was used to generate those profits. Any retention is illegal. Should a member exit the Fund leaving some of their earnings under reserves, they will not have benefited and that money will probably go to future members whose earnings were not used to generate those profits. One of these days a serious Member will file a law suit against the Fund only to expose the Fund to litigation waste of resources. They should also seek AG’s on this matter.

It’s my strong view that management at this stage must remind themselves the very justification of NSSF’s existence - to provide a social security safety net for its members whenever their social security is under threat, not single handedly trying to save the East African Economy as they would like us to believe (sec 2.2 of the letter). Besides, year on year, members are reminded how NSSF Uganda is the largest Fund in East Africa. This statement is always met with a Thunderous applause from its members and the public at large. But what does this exactly mean to a layman who has been contributing to NSSF for the last 20 years? NSSF has to walk the walk and talk the talk! This is the time for members to size up this “largest” Fund in EA. 
And for the humour: My brother T. Mirundi would say; If a man keeps preaching and boasting about his size, test that size by first asking him to buy you a small Toyota Rav 4. If he switches off his phones and relocates to another village, just know he was a Fake-master (Mufere) 

For simplicity’s sake, ILO and ISSA have put forward a range of standards and guidelines that are really a whole topic for another day, but simply put, for one to be socially secure is to have a roof over your head, have a daily meal, care for medical, have some gainful employment, and an income of sorts. For example members of NSSF in companies that are economically stressed have been laid off due to the prolonged effects of the Covid lockdown. If you step out for example and go to the sugar plantations across the country, people are counting on the arrival of Posho and beans from the National Task force. Other people have even lost their homes due to water bodies like Lake Victoria naturally claiming their homes and other property. Some members and their families not only starving but with rent and loan arrears and some have lost all their properties. Now if NSSF cannot come in at such a time for it’s desperate members, when shall they step in to “ease the noose” around their necks? Where is the better life that members have always been promised when they need it?

The Fund has sufficient headroom on profitability to play in the Fixed Income asset class without the need to call on the rest of its real estate and Equities portfolios. The Fund can afford this transaction especially if it’s staggered over time without causing any significant negative impact. The powers that be should find the political will to pull down this facade painted by NSSF management and pay the 20% especially to those members that need it. most first. A rejection of this proposal would be anything but economic!

[18/05/2020, 11:19:08] ‪+256 782 025341‬: By Henry Mutebe via Facebook

Someone asked me; Henry, why have you been quiet on policy issues? MPs are busy enjoying our money. What is your take? 

My answer. 
I have written, severally, that one of the problems of us Facebook people is that we underestimate the depth of  illiteracy of our population. The problem with being on Facebook and being educated is that we suffer from what they called the curse of knowledge. You assume that everyone knows what you know and therefore they 'automatically get it'. My friend, you don't know our people. 

Secondly, I have realised that I think I am the only person who was born in a village grew up in the village  and so I have a good idea of how majority of people in villages make their political choices. 

We are here talking about NSSF; how many people in the village know what that means OR even care?

You guys are here talking about increased taxes when many people in villages don't even know they pay taxes. Many dont understand at what point one pays the tax.

You are here talking about policies and macro economic policies, who understands those things of yours? 

The ordinary man in the village has land given to him by his father. He has a slave called a woman who tills that land and when the harvest is ready, he sells the produce, takes the money, drinks alcohol and in some cases marries another wife using the money generated by his wife's labour. 

You are talking about lost jobs! Hmmm. How many people in the village wake up to go to an office and work? The office is the garden and those offices are not closed. At least, for now, the people in villages are still working. Lost jobs and lockdown is a 'rich peoples' problem someone in the village recently told me.

The concerns of a an ordinary man in the village is sex from his wife, his land and access to alcohol and a witch doctor. If you deny them those four, then a revolution can start. 

Men in villages live like kings. They don't leave 'ezokukameza'. The woman has to look for food in the garden...and hunt for enva. Those things of leaving 10k mbu sente za kameza is kajanja of you, urban dwellers. The village woman feeds the man, offers sex, takes for him water to the bathroom and even has to be there and watch over him as he is showering. 

So many people who vote these MPs are completely in another world. They beg these MPs money. They are bought to vote, and indeed when MPs get to the Promised Land, it is time to pay themselves.

So, most times I am angry at these MPs but then I remember that they didn't take themselves to parliament. They were voted. Who voted them? Those people. Did they know what they were doing? I don't know. Should they pay for it? I don't know 

As Facebook people, many of you don't know the depth of the crisis we are in, because of the quality of of our voters. Those MPs know just too well who matters. It's not us who write long pieces on Facebook and share within our circles on issues we already agree on. 

Those MPs know who matters. 
In fact, when you hear them talking, don't think they are talking to you Kampala urban dwellers. They are talking to the average villager who doesn't even know how he pays his taxes, who doesn't care what NSSF is or who has even never been to Kampala. Do you know that probably 75% of rural dwellers have never left their regions to any other? 

Their view of life is so limited and you can't blame them. An MP that tells them that he or she will construct a road is the one they vote, as if MPs construct roads. The one who speaks more of the local languages anf has more proverbs is the one they call good. 

The average person in the village doesn't understand what you guys are talking about. He doesn't watch NTV or NBS political show or listen to business news segments. 

The average person likes Agataliko Nfufu where the report a person who gave birth to a frog or where two men are fighting for a woman or where the news is about two drunkards that organised a drinking competition. 

That's why Agataaliko Nfufu has more viewers and Bukedde newspaper sells more than Daily Monitor and New Vision. The content people consume tells you a lot about that population 

Many of our people are not able to process most of these things. They generally don't mind the status quo. In fact, for many, as long as they are seated on a malwa pot, they have no problem with anybody.

They are okay. The day you understand that Full Figure, Mama Fina, and others in that caliber have more power and influence than a professor at Makerere University, that's the day you will discover that we were born at the wrong time. The critical mass of our country are still raw; functionally illiterate and not exposed at all and they are the majority voters. 

The day you will appreciate that concept, you will understand what I am talking about.

Sometimes, I wish those MPs can add themselves as much money as they want. Probably, sell us. To that point where the ordinary person will wake up and understand that his MP ought to represent him or her in a certain way. For now, those people are still comfortable and the MPs know that too well. So they will act with as much impunity as the voters can allow them.

So, what I am doing these days, is to dedicate some time to raising children and giving them 
an opportunity to keep alive. Maybe. Just maybe, when we move on as the current generation. Maybe, these children will sort this country. 

As of now, we need to go back to basics. Go to villages. Teach people how to write their names. How to load airtime. How to see a woman as a full human being. How to do basic things which we take for granted. These people voted those MPs. They laid their bed. It's time to sleep in it. Sadly, all of us feel the heat. 

The problem is not MPs...the problem is the millions that vote those type of MPs. If you don't agree with me...go to your village and try to contest for any political office. That's the day you will discover that your father is a witch. He Bewitched other people's children so that you succeed. You took their blessings. That's the day you will know that your education is a problem. It's the day you will understand that the truth never wins you an election in a village. 

We don't have a critical mass of people to vote a value laden parliament.

Our society is still raw and was just picked from another political civilisation into a democratic political civilisation. We don't have the social software to generate a good parliament. So, I am not sure if I should burden myself with discussing MPs. 

Everyday, I only cry at the quality of our population.

[18/05/2020, 11:25:00] Luckson S.A @: The person who photoshopped did well coz that is exactly what many said including kenyatta... my colleague was not allowed bk to zim to attend funeral of his son
[18/05/2020, 11:36:30] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: Hadn't seen it 👍🏽👍🏽
[18/05/2020, 11:38:52] Viola Nagadya @: He's strategy ws to scoop doz liabilities wc he already got
[18/05/2020, 13:33:05] Mugerwa Alvin @: Hehe I think the later is still true bro
[18/05/2020, 14:07:57] Viola Nagadya @: Guy is building his bonus percentage
[18/05/2020, 14:12:18] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: The funniest thing is the guy's making the most noise are not even formally employed. 
Also, the guy has said donate, if you don't want, it won't be mandatory..plus what's 10k honestly guys.. 🤦🏽‍♂
[18/05/2020, 14:13:07] Brian M @: But to honestly it was a good initiative.
[18/05/2020, 14:13:28] Baguma Robert @: Go and  watch transporter
[18/05/2020, 14:13:46] Baguma Robert @: It's not about the  money but the principle
[18/05/2020, 14:14:28] Brian M @: Even in principle it adds up. The only shortfall is transparency in the spending
[18/05/2020, 14:16:00] Baguma Robert @: Principle doesnt add up...govt that's good at wasting money on bebe cool , butchman ....has no moral authority to beg
[18/05/2020, 14:16:16] Baguma Robert @: Its like Bryan white begging for money
[18/05/2020, 14:16:28] Viola Nagadya @: Btw pipo are willing to give bt how is da moni used dts there worry
[18/05/2020, 14:17:11] Mugerwa Alvin @: Hehe  So why not make a public appeal as opposed to writing to the CEOs?
[18/05/2020, 14:18:38] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: CEOs will trickle down the information and request for approval. It is illegal for them to deduct the money without your consent. I highly doubt that was his intention (to deduct without an employers consent)
[18/05/2020, 14:18:57] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: *employee's consent
[18/05/2020, 14:20:29] Mugerwa Alvin @: So how optional is it for the currently CE, don't u think the trickling is already above her?
[18/05/2020, 14:20:32] Bukenya Ronald @: Man these are two kilograms of posho and one kilograms of beans
[18/05/2020, 14:22:28] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: So what's the alternative? we spend 10k on beer and pray the needy sort themselves out? I'd rather they chew my 5k and give 5k to the people - Short term. 
Long term we build resilient systems that can actually account for these types of donations
[18/05/2020, 14:23:20] Mugerwa Alvin @: It's pure implied authority except the aspect of "reasonable" is certainly lacking
[18/05/2020, 14:25:19] Mugerwa Alvin @: I'd rather spend it on a beer than watching it given to bebecool and full figure. Don't forget accountability of what's bn contributed yet is still under scrutiny following the irregularities and  ofcourse as expected
[18/05/2020, 14:27:36] Baguma Robert @: M7 and wife have just received 300 billion in supplementary... what does a family of two need 300 billion ..2 months to end of a financial  year ....u jazz us mbu donations
[18/05/2020, 14:28:06] Viola Nagadya @: Look for a needy en hand it over urself it doesn't need Gov't intervention infact we've given more than dat 10k they're looking for.
[18/05/2020, 14:28:48] Viola Nagadya @: Yet he feeds on cassava en tea
[18/05/2020, 14:30:04] Mugerwa Alvin @: Btw M6+1 and the committee each contributes 1m off their monthly pay. Good ryt? Does it rationalise with someone earning 400k paying 10k "optionally"
[18/05/2020, 14:30:04] Viola Nagadya @: IMF hs jst reduced released funds let them first account for wat they have before they yearn for more
[18/05/2020, 14:31:21] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: 😂😂 you guys are mob pissed, let me go back to my series. Bottom line, I think it's a good initiative, however your points are valid, accountability etc..I would personally still pay the 10k
[18/05/2020, 14:31:54] ‪+256 700 370191‬: now i have someone to pay ma 10k.....
[18/05/2020, 14:33:29] Mugerwa Alvin @: Hehe yes u wud, because u hvnt possibly helped anyone yet during this time OR you hvnt watched the presidential fortnightly show tv
[18/05/2020, 14:35:53] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: Boss, I have so many relas in the village and kla who I have personally helped during this crisis

[18/05/2020, 14:36:36] Viola Nagadya @: En 10k doesnt hold the same to all employees Let them say 0.1% such my 10k is matched with a million from the likes of CEs☹️
[18/05/2020, 14:37:05] Baguma Robert @: U don't pay PAYE
[18/05/2020, 14:37:12] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: This is a fair point
[18/05/2020, 14:37:16] Mugerwa Alvin @: Hehe u hv my momo number, wait on that alert bruh 😎
[18/05/2020, 14:38:07] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: True, but anyone earning more than 500k after tax shouldn't have a problem with 10k..I could be wrong
[18/05/2020, 14:38:08] Bukenya Ronald @: Mbu classified expenditure. Atte Balina okusasula abanyampi likes of Bebe... Kusasira

[18/05/2020, 14:40:40] Byalero Ronald @: but paying 10K is not an issue as  long as it goes to a body like Redcross where the possibility of reaching the pipo is 95%
[18/05/2020, 14:41:05] Mugerwa Alvin @: Those were the vulnerable poor at that time 😂😂😂

[22/05/2020, 12:13:39] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: My point is the white man (English/American western) is a master at disguising exploitation. He has made us Africans forget, we also didn't understand English back then, but schools and church etc made us learn. China has exploited Africa for the past 10/20 years. The white man has been doing so for the past 200 plus. All I'm saying is China is also trying to exploit us but they are not as harsh (slave trade / killing locals etc). China (Asia) is the new world order and we need to wake up to that. Infact we can learn a lot from them. He should use his energy elsewhere.
[22/05/2020, 12:15:41] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: Fyi, I have travelled to a lot of countries and there are Chinese billboards almost everywhere I've gone. There's even Chinatowns in most. Entire towns. That's their strategy, they don't come to enslave, they come to trade.
[22/05/2020, 12:18:40] Luckson S.A @: that is natural society interactions.. for centuries Bunyoro was the dominant force in the region using mytholody and history to claim ownership of the land... but its position was challenged by the rapid rise of Buganda, a neighbouring kingdom that had once been a collection of cultivators on the shores of Lake Victoria 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
[22/05/2020, 12:19:46] Mugerwa Alvin @: I think the white man had his era during the colonial times. The Chinese are masking the same right now, not using divide and rule, but rather come thru donations, grants and later loans which many third world countries can't really pay off
[22/05/2020, 12:21:20] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: But they are not forcing us, our greedy leaders are the ones to blame.
[22/05/2020, 12:23:54] Luckson S.A @: true, unfortunately chinese make the ruling elite rich and fuck the next generations.
[22/05/2020, 12:24:02] Mugerwa Alvin @: Yeah that's true. They are taking advantage of our political posture and economic situation just like the white man did when we exchanged 20 slaves for a mirror 🤦🏻‍♂

[02/06/2020, 17:57:42] Brian M @: one may argue that the benefit is felt on govt services but zero 60%
[02/06/2020, 17:58:24] Baguma Robert @: Those guys only thing you pay for is beer
[02/06/2020, 17:59:40] Luckson S.A @: did u guys understand that writing or u just saw %ages
[02/06/2020, 18:00:20] Byalero Ronald @: The wailing isn't on the 30% it's in the fact that it's being given to bebe cool and buchamam through supplementary entertainment budget while hospitals have no gloves
[02/06/2020, 18:01:10] Byalero Ronald @: Doctors who worked during covid not being paid on time yet the donations come in on time and the money is for mainly vehicles

[02/06/2020, 18:17:16] Kaaya Stanley @: Better than taking my 30% and giving it to full figure
[02/06/2020, 18:18:10] Byalero Ronald @: The true test to that statement will be the next time u go to hospital after leaving formal employment and u have nor medical card
[02/06/2020, 18:19:30] Byalero Ronald @: Or when any close  relative who isn't on any medical scheme goes to nakasero  or Kampala hospital or paragon
[02/06/2020, 18:23:16] Brian M @: Boss how often does that happen. to give you a clearer picture. look at ur current take home.... that is what u pay as tax in those countries. Now think again.

[03/06/2020, 08:22:35] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: There's another angle to look at, you consumed all these products when growing up. You were born in a hospital at almost zero cost, free educatuon, free transport, plus your food has been subsidized from birth. So even as a bachelor you have to pay tax so the next generation can grow up with the comforts you did. Or at the bare minimum pay back what you used.
[03/06/2020, 09:48:28] Brian M @: wapi, I had no choice to refuse the service at the time

[03/06/2020, 10:03:18] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: Dude, check the mortality. Very few babies were living past their 1st birthdays. That's why our grandparents had 10 kids. It was a numbers game. Birth 15 and like 7 make it to adulthood. The truth is the white man's medicine has helped. Anyway lets not digress, I was just calling out your logic of bachelors not paying tax
[03/06/2020, 10:11:53] Brian M @: Dude at the end of the day there was a working system before.
[03/06/2020, 10:13:00] Kalanda Habib @: Who told you the mortality rate was high? Let me guess the same white man...

[03/06/2020, 10:17:08] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: Habib, we all grew up in Africa and saw this first hand. My grandparents on my dad's side had 12 kids. 2 didn't see their first birthday. 2 didn't make it past 10. 8 remained and most of them have been taken, I won't go into details.
My parents had TWO kids and we have both lived past 30 with almost zero health issues. No polio, diptheria, tuberclosis etc
[03/06/2020, 10:32:52] Luckson S.A @: don't refuse historical facts dude.. Mortality rate was huge, death of kids was more like normal and funerals were not held, in my culture they will just dig a hole on river bank so the water can wipe out. My grademother had 13 kids and 4 never servived infant... My great grandfather was a champion 5 wives and  60 kids including those from gfs

[03/06/2020, 14:31:34] Kalanda Habib @: That was terrible abt your relatives. Respectfully, that does not necessarily provide the statistics. Truth be told the statistics are hard to come by unless you will believe history passed down orally. Many conventional people today will not. With that in mind I remain sceptical of any figures or "historical facts" a colonising force will provide especially as they seek to justify their actions.

[06/06/2020, 21:17:15] Byalero Ronald @: From an anonymous source but profound! Please read:

_A few months ago I was speaking to a wealthy property developer based in Durban (he's white). While chatting to him, he told me that the business model I was telling him about was similar to that of Trafalgar. He then emailed the CEO of Trafalgar and introduced me._

_The businessman then told me that his father and the founder of Trafalgar (the father of the current CEO) had been friends for more than 40 years. He then told me that the CEO of Trafalgar is more like a brother to him. This made me realise that relationships are the biggest capital rich people have._

_I looked into my own family and realised that there's no 40 year relationship my family has with another family. I began looking around and realised that most black people don't have those kinds of relationships, especially business relationships. A lot of people in our community don't even have friendships that have lasted more than 20 years. It's rare to find those._

_Our people have been conditioned to compete with one another so much, that even when they have genuine relationships with people that can help them, they turn those relationships into competition. We don't have a problem with lack of capital, we have a relationship deficiency. There are many people who can fund your business today, but you just don't have a strong enough relationship with them. You have not deposited enough into the relationship to be able to withdraw from it._

_Relationships are resources. There are things I wouldn't have been able to do if I wasn't connected to certain individuals or families. Those people willingly put their money on the line to back me and my family. It's sad that most of our people haven't developed the maturity and know-how to cultivate long term relationships. They move from one friendship to another the same way most move from one romantic relationship to another. There's no long term vision._

_Let me tell you something, relationships are the capital that you are looking for. You don't need money to start a business. You need solid relationships with people who will be willing to back you up. Who do you think funded Facebook at the early stage? It was someone who knew someone who knew someone._ 

_So if you don't have money, you withdraw from your relationship bank account. I'm also praying and working on long-term relationships with people. It's not easy, relationships go through seasons, but with prayer and maturity - we can cultivate relationships that our children will be able to Withdraw from 40 years later..!

What kind of relationships are you nurturing?

[11/06/2020, 19:48:49] Luckson S.A @: *What is most brutal thing Bill Gates has done?*
The cruelest thing Bill has ever done was in regard to him trying to Dilute the equity of his co-founder, this was mentioned in Paul Allen’s autobiography “Idea Man: A Memoir by the Co-founder of Microsoft”
_"One evening in late December 1982, I heard Bill and Steve speaking heatedly in Bill's office and paused outside to listen in_," he writes in his memoir. "It was easy to get the gist of the conversation. They were bemoaning my recent lack of production and discussing how they might dilute my Microsoft equity by issuing options to themselves and other shareholders. It was clear that they'd been thinking about this for some time. (Paul Allen: Gates, Ballmer tried to 'rip me off')

The lack of productivity wasn't intentional, Allen claims. A few months earlier, he was informed by doctors that he had Stage 1-A Hodgkin's lymphoma. He stayed on at Microsoft during his treatment, but Allen says that he was a victim of Gates and Ballmer at his weakest moment.

By early 1983, Allen says, he was finally ready to move on from Microsoft. According to the Vanity Fair excerpt, he and Gates tried to hash out a deal for him to leave, a deal he says resulted in "a lowball offer for my stock: five dollars a share."

Allen said he held out for $10 per share, but Gates balked at the idea. He left Microsoft in 1983 without selling his ownership in Microsoft.

That was a good move on Allen’s part because as of today, he is worth close to $20 Billion Dollars.

[06/07/2020, 15:20:47] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: So getting the software to do what you want it to do will get a lot more easier with time. Best analogy is how manual cars are being phased out and auto is the new thing

Reason one needs to get high-level as before the market forces do the trick .

But remember problem solving is different from just programming. So highly analytical resources are going to be more marketable than just programmers

Question is who develops those systems. One must challenge themselves to get to such levels of problem solving

Simon Smith, 53, was knocked to the ground by an out of control bus in Reading UK, but CCTV footage shows him get straight back to his feet moments later and walk into the Purple Turtle pub where he was originally headed. Luckily he sustained only minor scratches and bruising despite being thrown about 20 feet!

Moral of the story? 

When life (and business) feels like you’ve been hit by a bus, be like Simon:

Get back up.

Dust yourself off.

Carry on to the pub.....!

[13/08/2020, 14:55:50] ‪+256 782 025341‬: Growing up, I noticed something very interesting: A lot of the men in my town who were in the formal economy and could rely on monthly income, died shortly after coming to retirement, normally between three and five years.

Many of them, would have just semi-completed their building projects (not done but still habitable).

The next thing is for them to finally invest some of their SSNIT cash into their wives’ business (normally groceries store).

Unfortunately, a couple of them still pay fees of children (normally out of wedlock).

They then suddenly die.

The superstitious inclination of the local folks triggered rumours that the poor widow, the wife “knows something about the death” because she wanted the house and the petty business all for herself.

Sometimes family members would even go and enquire from the oracles what killed their man?

But come to think of it, what really killed these men?

I believe it is the “ pension shock” syndrome:

1. A lot of these men will work for an average of 30 years in the formal sector religiously depending solely on their salaries.

2. Personal savings and investments are very alien to them. They chop everything they earn.

3. They believe their biggest security is their children who will come and take care of them when they are old.

4. There is over reliance on the SSNIT pension. They believe the bulk money will take care of all their problems, including starting/completing their building project.

5. At the peak of their career, they are so indulged in the pleasures of this life, busily funding the “side chick economy” and fathering all manner of children outside their matrimonial homes.

6. Then the day comes, they turn 60. They receive a letter from their employers, it is time to go. Bungalows are vacated, a truck is made ready to transport them back to the destination of choice.

7. Some move to family houses temporarily (or even permanently), others move into their hastily and shabbily completed homes, mainly funded by the proceeds from their pension.

8. Funny enough, they realise there was nothing lumpy about the “lump sum” SSNIT paid them. The money is all gone at this time, and they are forced to solely depend on the monthly pensions, which is a pale version of what they received as working class.

9. Some attempt to farm, with no prior experience, others help casually at their wives’ provision shop, majority sit in their lazy couch most of the day, reading through the dailies with their radio set by them at their porch, intermittently receiving greetings from passers-by.

10. They spiral into bouts of depression when it dawns on them that by being old and broke, they’ve become half (or even less) the men they were. Majority don’t survive this mental turmoil and die before their time.

11. They may also run to contest a chieftaincy stool with the aim of continuing life. The battle of securing the stool coupled with its litigation is also another problem to think of.

So what can we learn from our fathers?

1. Take control of your financial independence. Invest consistently during your working life. SSNIT should not be your plan A.

2. Little drops of money wasted today, will cost you your harvest tomorrow. Keep your focus, avoid the “side chicks” and “side children”.

3. Don’t plan your old age around your children, many of them may not find their feet before you die.

4. Set your spouse up early. Invest in her business when you have access to loan facilities and make sure before you go into retirement, the business is already established.

5. Complete your building many years ahead of retirement. Your pension is not meant for that.

6. Get other sources of income. You have decades of your working life to develop a sustainable side business.

Be determined to retire a rich man. After all, the good book says “the righteous man leaves an inheritance for their children’s children.

Nobody is fond of a broke pensioner. Determine not to become one, otherwise you run the risk of becoming one.

[17/08/2020, 11:38:43] Luckson S.A @: I may not understand the language but using firearm in public is the last option if and only if u are saving life.. there was no life to save.. even if he drove away they can still catch him.. they have car details., they know where he stays... Primary mission of the police is to save life

[17/08/2020, 11:46:07] ‪+256 782 025341‬: Why would you even think of trying to disarm an officer?  How stupid can you be?🤣🤣🤣. It's just stupid. You stop and comply. Once proven innocent they will let you go.  But you want to be the culprit and then the judge and set your self free
[17/08/2020, 11:46:13] Baguma Robert @: The same way we are trained to follow procedures in our IT step by step but we usually do contrary

[17/08/2020, 11:49:48] Luckson S.A @: or people will not respect police.. they are very few on that clip and people can easily defeat them.. and when that happens not even the military can win this war
[17/08/2020, 11:50:32] Luckson S.A @: when people without guns stand up to people with guns, it's usually the armed that run for cover

[17/08/2020, 13:10:06] ‪+256 772 532030‬: My understanding is that People in uniform only fire their weapons when given an order or when their life is threatened?🤷‍♂️
[17/08/2020, 13:11:28] Baguma Robert @: They're human beings before being in police uniform
[17/08/2020, 13:22:31] Luckson S.A @: hence they are trained to behave like officers of the law. they can't behave like any1 else on the street. If they were humans like any1 they should join demonstrations for increase in  cost of living coz they suffer same problems like any1

[05/06/2021, 10:15:19] ‪+27 84 764 9674‬: Do you want to know what a scam is?

 A scam is having the Bible translated into Swahili, Igbo, Yoruba, Zulu, Tswana, Ndebele and every other African language, but having zero scientific book translated into a single African language. That, is a conspiracy. That, is a trap. And that, is a scam. Someone who can be scammed with the same trick over and over again for decades upon decades, is considered a fool and their gullibility and lack of critical thinking make them willing participants in their own demise. 

I have walked into different libraries and I've seen University Science Books translated into Chinese, Russian, Portuguese, French, German, Spanish and so forth. I've seen,  Think And Grow Rich by Napolean Hill translated into French. I've seen the Japanese version of A Man's Search For Meaning. I've seen a Spanish version of The Alchemist. I've seen the Korean version of The Art of War. All of these books, I've seen them in various languages but NOT in any African language. 

You will never find a church in Africa where the English speaking preacher would not have a native translator next to them doing the translation. 
Here's where the scam comes in: you also will never find a school in Africa where the English speaking teacher WILL be having a native translator next to them translating Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Geography, Economics etc to the students.

I've seen many Science Books translated into various languages but NONE in any African language. The Chinese are taught Mathematics in Chinese. The Japanese are taught Engineering in Japanese. They're all taught Finance, Astrophysics, Medicine, Accounting, Geology, Management, Government and so on in their languages. The ONLY book that Africans have in their language IS THE BIBLE. And the ONLY time Africans have something translated to them in their language IS IN A CHURCH.

*Important Historical Facts*

_THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THIS_

The Black African, the wretched of the earth, is the only member of the human race who has been brainwashed to think that his ancestors bequeathed him with a curse that has prevented him from attaining aspired goals and life desires. Almost every misfortune he encounters on earth is the fault of some ancestors... who must be bound and cast with the fire of the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus.

The white people don't have terrible ancestors who have done terrible things. No. It's only the black ancestor. Over the years, the black ancestor has been so vilified by Christians they pay tithes, stay up all night, fast and pray to destroy the African ancestor in the name of Jesus. The black ancestor is so wicked he cursed his own kids.

Having cursed his ancestor who gave him life, the black man is roaming around the world like a tortoise without a shell. He has no backbone. Zero identity. Thus no race respects him. He's lynched in Malaysia, incarcerated in Cambodia. He's shot like a dog in the streets of America. In Europe, he cleans the white man's shit. And they spit on him. Why won't they? A man who hates himself and despises his roots deserves no respect whatsoever.

John Hawkins was a foremost English slave trader, a thief, and by contemporary moral standards he can as well be called a terrorist. John Hawkins made three trips to West Africa in the 1560s, and stole Africans whom he sold to the Spanish in America. On returning to England after the first trip, his profit was so handsome that Queen Elizabeth I became interested in directly participating in his next venture; and she provided for that purpose a ship named JESUS. Hawkins left with JESUS to steal some more Africans, and he returned to England with such dividends that Queen Elizabeth made him a knight. Hawkins chose as his coat of arms the representation of an African in chains.

Today the generations of Hawkins and Queen Elizabeth I are alive and enjoying life from the proceeds of their Evil ancestors. They don't demonise their ancestors despite their active involvement in the greatest evil humanity has ever witnessed. Both individuals sanctioned rape, kidnapping and mass murder, but their children don't bear "ancestral curses" like black Africans. You'd be hard pressed to see a member of the British elite publicly denounce slavery.

Isn't it time to emancipate yourself from mental slavery oh ye Negro? If ancestral curse exists, who should suffer from it? The ancestor who kidnapped and raped and murdered and pillaged and stole and enslaved his fellow man, or the man whose freedom was taken from him? Surely, the man who threw pregnant Negro women to sharks at Sea because they were too weak, deserves his future generations to suffer and not the man whose society was so pure they had no prisons to punish offenders.

Do these Black Africans who will go to church today binding and casting "ancestral curses", know that almost all the top British politicians from the 17th century till the 19th century were proud slave merchants? It is on record that 15 Lord Mayors of London, 25 sheriffs and 38 aldermen of the City of London were shareholders in the Royal Africa Company (RAC) between 1660-1690. The RAC alone was responsible for trafficking over 1.5million Negroes to Britain and twice that number to the Caribbean.

David and Alexander Barclays were active participants in the kidnapping and enslavement of millions of black Africans. As was standard practice at the time, the risky and long-term nature of transatlantic slave trading required new banking houses that could offer credits to prospective slave traders, for periods of between one and a half to three years. One bank that provided this service was run by Alexander and David Barclay. Their bank still carries their name. The Barclay's Bank is also a proud sponsor of the English Premier league that me and you are fanatical fans of Chelsea and Arsenal and Man United today.

Their children don't bind and cast their ancestral evil, rather it is the Negro whose ancestors were dehumanised and tortured and enslaved, that keeps praying against "ancestral curses."

The Bank of England was also involved in the slave trade. Sir Richard Neaves, who was the director of the bank for 48 years, was also the chairman of the Society of West India Merchants. A group of vile men who stole Africans and made handsome profits by selling them on to farmers who needed them to work in their sugar and tobacco plantations in the West Indies.

Today Liverpool Football club will be playing Tottenham Hotspur in the Barclay's premier League. Pay attention. How many of you who are Liverpool supporters today know that the initial founders of that football club were retired slave traders, whom in 1892, with slavery outlawed, decided to invest their money in a football club that will reap future rewards for their generations to come via a bank called Arthur Heywood and Sons & Co.. That bank would be absorbed in turn by the Bank of Liverpool, Martin’s Bank and Barclay’s Bank.

You watch them and shout in ecstasy when they score. But a pastor somewhere will tell you the reason you're poor is because your ancestors committed evil, hence the reason you experience ill luck. And you will believe and start casting and binding rubbish!

For your information, Liverpool was a major port for the transatlantic slave trade. Slave ships were often built or repaired in Liverpool. Nearly one and a half million Africans were forcibly transported across the Atlantic in Liverpool ships. The 'Liverpool Merchant' was the first recorded slave ship to sail from Liverpool. She set sail on 3 October 1699 and arrived in Barbados on 18 September 1700 with a cargo of 220 enslaved Africans. Part owner Sir Thomas Johnson is known as the 'founder of modern Liverpool'.

Liverpool city wouldn't be what it is today without the trade in black Africans. The personal and civic wealth gained from slaving cemented the foundations for the Liverpool's future growth.

The children and grandchildren and great grand children of the perpetrators of this monstrosity against the black Man enjoy heaven here on earth, and live in more stable environment. They have managed to stabilise their society and solve their problem and live in relative peace.

But the Negro ancestors, the wretched of the earth, who was kidnapped and his freedom forcefully taken away from him; he was sentenced to a plantation for the rest of his life. It is this ancestor an bed many others who is demonised by Christians as having bequeathed their offsprings with "curses".

This is a historical fact our African brothers and sisters should be aware of....

Kudos to the author of this great piece. 👍🏾

[07/06/2021, 01:28:59] ‪+256 782 025341‬: Hi friends. I need to share a simple solution on corvid19 regarding coughing and oxygen intake. Am told that failure to take in oxygen is the biggest problem for corvid patients. 

On Thursday I drove to Mbarara and found my sister inlaw with some flue and body weakness. I told her to get in the car and we go for a quick test. The test turned out positive. And immediately she started medication. Now on Saturday she developed high intensity coughing. I went to town and bought an inhaler: the common asthma inhaler. The coughing immediately stopped! And up to a few minutes ago, she has not coughed at all and her oxygen intake is steady at 96/97.

Is this information available to our patients? An inhaler costs 10k and an oxygen intake tester costs 100k. These 2 can save your life. 

Feel free to share.

[09/06/2021, 17:27:08] ‪+256 782 025341‬: This is an excellent article written by a Ugandan citizen analysing the systemic rot in all African nations with Uganda as a case study. 

This is food for thought!!!!!!

The biggest problem of Ugandans or Africans in general is this illusionary belief that they could change their countries by voting a different person into power. It is this belief that all problems of a country start and stop with the President. That if you could just have the right man in power, then all of a sudden, Africa would transform. This is what they call chasing a mirage, imagining some utopia. Unfortunately utopias are never realized in life. 

The actual problem of Africa is not the presidents. From where do these presidents come? From within. The problem of Africa, the problem of Uganda is its citizens, their shared values and mentalities. The day Africans wakeup, and stop looking for an external enemy and realize that they themselves are Africa's problem is the day we shall get closer to finding an African solution. 

I have often told friends that I am happiest whenever the MPs draw bigger salaries every financial year. As Ugandans we lambast our representatives in public for drawing these salaries. In private, we drain our MPs. We invite them for funerals, for introduction ceremonies and expect them to contribute out of pocket to save us. A Ugandan MP attends no less than 10 functions in a week on average. They are expected to find jobs for their people. They must contribute towards the least of needs. These big salaries they draw, they all go straight to the people they represent. Yet it seems some of us live in an illusion called Uganda. We expect our MPs to act as MPs in UK except that in our case, we also expect to play donor to their people's needs. 

We decry the corruption in the country yet we bribe to get our children in the best schools. We bribe our way out of police tickets. We have no respect for traffic rules. We are every evil we see in the president and his team. 

Every ill you can diagnose in Museveni and his government, you will find twice or thrice the magnitude in a Ugandan citizen. 

We complain of government incompetence, yet go ahead to champion incompetence in every aspect of our lives where government has no control. Our carpenters produce substandard furniture. 

I often ask myself; if the public sector is too incompetent, how come the private sector has not been any better? How come you are more bound to have a misdiagnosis in a private hospital than in a public hospital? 

Daily Monitor, Observer, Red Pepper, New Vision write stories everyday that highlight government incompetence. Yet, there will never be a single day where you will pick up a Ugandan newspaper and fail to find an error on every page. 

Perhaps one day as Ugandans we ought to self reflect, and look within and realize, that we are demons we are trying to fight. If Museveni and his government were the only incompetent people and everyone else was competent, then Uganda would be a scandinavian country of sorts. Why don't we have world class restaurants in the country? Why is it that customer care sucks in private institutions just as it does in public institutions? 

Every Ugandan I meet complains of the system, of the incompetence. Then I ask myself; "you dear Ugandan, where can I find examples of your excellent output?" 

The same people who complain of poor working conditions run slavery rings in their own homes. The day maids of this country decide to speak out, we shall be shocked at the evil we sustained in our homes. 

I now suspect that our anger, our rants, our complaints about the system are all because this system is a daily reminder of our own incompetences, our own weaknesses as a people. What this government has done is hold a mirror up to the Ugandan society and we are not happy about our own reflection. 

Today I read a sad story. That there are about 20,000 Asians in Uganda, less than 0.5% of the Ugandan Population. And that these pay 64% of our tax revenues. To put it simply, even the taxes we complain that government mishandles, more than half of them are paid by non-Ugandans. In other words, we don't even have a right to complain. 

That should signify an innate Ugandan problem. There is something deeply wrong around how the Ugandan and African societies are constructed. Ugandan Citizens promise so much and deliver so little. Our shared beliefs, mindsets and values have been constructed in such a way that regardless of the president in power, we shall always produce substandard results. It is no wonder that all over Africa, we complain of the same problems. Littered cities, corruption, failed government institutions, name it all. You could fly from Uganda to Malawi to Ghana to Zambia and not notice a difference. Because? It is not a problem of presidents. It is a problem of the African citizens. But they are too scared of self-criticism, they have dabbled in escapism and found scapegoats in their leaders.

As Plato wrote in the Republic; "like man, like state." We can't expect to have better leaders until we have better people. You can't create great companies without great employees. It doesn't matter how great the CEO is, if she has crap employees, she will have a crap company. That is the case of Uganda and other African countries!

[09/06/2021, 17:48:48] Byalero Ronald @: This also explains all the issues opposition has in Uganda coz in actual sense the difference between the person on the sideline and the one eating is just lack of opportunity
[09/06/2021, 17:48:49] Baguma Robert @: The author is right to some extent but in others he makes baised analysis.  
Yes M7 might not be the only problem Uganda faces but him leaving that's one of the many problems resolved.  Like in IT  system instability might be due to many causes but you Jona making network stable reduce the number of possible causes.  
Now most of the issues highlighted raised are about institution failure which most of them in Uganda due to regime longevity.  Just imagine every two presidential terms we would have new permanent secretaries, new heads of authority, new army commanders, new heads of police etc . Look at stanbic, Philip left , Patrick came , now anne ...all of them with fresh ideas , new personal.  
On the lighter note 20,000 asians who they do trade with 44 million ugandans.  Its utter garbage to say the revenue comes from them
[09/06/2021, 17:50:33] ‪+256 782 025341‬: Okay. Kati @256791783893  summarise what roba has said without including Nyanya mbisi😂😂

[09/06/2021, 17:51:14] Baguma Robert @: Two terms is the solution
[09/06/2021, 17:54:32] Byalero Ronald @: Yes but that is also compounded by the fact that as a pipo we are also too short sighted in that even when a good cause starts as soon as money starts flying we get the money and worry about the cause later corruption has gotten to our bones 
Someone will eat 15mil to endorse no term limits ans worry about the consequences later and even the one who got rhe terms won't hand over to his own kids he will worry about succession when he cant walk anymore

[13/06/2021, 20:17:54] ‪+256 782 025341‬: SNIPPETS from today’s talk by Dr. Diana Atwine

1. Superspreaders are schools, travellers.

2. Five Covid Variants in Uganda: 
a) Ugandan - not as virulent as others.
b) Indian - 3 subtypes.
c) Nigerian- not as virulent.
d) South Africa - virulent 
e) Kent(UK) - virulent 

3. Young people (20-39 years mainly) are dying in Uganda due to those variants. 

4. Vaccination for all Ugandans is the way forward chn inclusive. 

5. Take everyone around you as a potential covid case. Most homes have infections. 

6. Infections =inflammation (body immune battling the virus by cytokine storm) its this body over response that cause most people to die.

7. Self Medication is becoming a big problem, some of those medications people use can switch off the immune system. If you are not coughing there is no need for Antibiotics. She cautions against the use of Dexa (a serious steroid that can raise ones blood pressure). Should only be used in severe cases. Steroids dumpen the body hypnotizing the antibodies. 

8. Steaming has no much effect on the virus but can give that psychological feeling that you have done something / sense of relief to breathe a bit better. 

9. Best efficacy for 2nd vaccination doze is 12th week 86%. 8th week offers 76% protection. Because we are in a pandemic 2nd dose is ok from 8 weeks. 

10. 14% Break through cases (people getting Covid after both vaccines). This is because diff bodies react differently to vaccines / late response to vaccine. In most cases when this happens cases are not as severe. 

11. It’s true there are few vaccine dozes left in ctry -50k.   175k doses expected next week & for both priority is people who got the first vaccine dose. You are only safe 2 weeks after second dose. 

12. It’s not advisable 
 to take cross vaccines ie 1st doze AstraZeneca and 2nd Johnson & Johnson. Leads to auto immune senario where the body starts fighting itself.

13. It’s possible to get a false negative test depending on timing ie if you test 10 days after infection  or 2-3 days immediately after exposure.

14. Covid is going to be with us for sometime. Overtime we will learn to get along with business. In future we may get booster dozes. The different Covid waves will continue until all people are vaccinated . We are also not sure of how long the vaccines will protect. 

15. Bronchoscopy is effective if done before covid severity - may cause cardiac arrest among others. It also cannot be employed for everyone. 

Prevention: 
*SOPs.*
Clean Mask (Nose/Mouth covering). Hand hygiene, avoid social gatherings

Stay safe

[27/06/2021, 23:30:09] Kalanda Habib @: All advancements in any society have been spearheaded by the leadership of the time and their willingness to kickstart such advancements. That has been the case for all ages.

Sooo...if we stagnate, why shldnt we look at the leadership in this age? Hehehe
[27/06/2021, 23:32:55] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: Closing statement, we've blamed our leaders for 35 yrs and gotten nowhere right.. I can assure the next person after Sevo will not be any better. So we have atleast another 30 plus years of bad leadership. Why don't we try something different and maybe just try and make ourselves more accountable

[29/06/2021, 10:10:09] ‪+256 774 988974‬: I think when you to social media you will find out how many are actually not using it because it is not approved.

[29/06/2021, 10:20:30] Baguma Robert @: Read through the testimonies
[29/06/2021, 10:21:07] Baguma Robert @: Most people who are using aren't people with a choice
[29/06/2021, 10:22:59] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Exactly, now you don’t have to wait to reach that state before you use it. That’s what the approval means. Means doctors can prescribe it
[29/06/2021, 10:23:49] Baguma Robert @: People are already using it
[29/06/2021, 10:24:03] Baguma Robert @: Even without doctor prescription
[29/06/2021, 10:24:30] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Yes but it goes a long way if your doctor prescribed it
[29/06/2021, 10:25:21] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Remember much as it is approved, so many will go on to say it is still experimental because there isn’t much data except for the testimonies

[29/06/2021, 10:34:46] Baguma Robert @: May be that ..  in a country where you can get any drug from pharmacy without prescription.  NDA is useless when it comes to these things like codivex . Most people have already stocked it wait for the rainy day .  Some doctors were already using it on patients. 
Where as NHS, EMA, FDA once they say not approved.  No one uses it , no pharmacy gives it ...no doctors administers it .. more so no manufacturer continues supplying it . 
In Uganda, manufacturer continued supplying with NDA saying not yet approved
[29/06/2021, 10:36:45] Baguma Robert @: I personally bought some
[29/06/2021, 10:36:58] Baguma Robert @: Not even on a black market

I don’t dispute anything you’ve said up there but first I want you to appreciate the magnitude of this ka approval even as a supporting drug. Even though everyone bought it, there is a reason it is breaking news everywhere

[29/06/2021, 10:38:53] ‪+256 782 278580‬: I think since it's now approved the guy should refine it more......Me am using it.I have been having caugh (not covid) and yes it works but with other medication.

[29/06/2021, 10:43:38] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Now that they are approved. The manufacturer will tell us the authorized places to buy from. Ignore those repackaging and bottle things. The people faking will get more creative

"The funds will be invested in Rwanda’s Foods and Drugs Authority establishing a strong quality control for medical products, which will help the authority achieve the required certification by the World Health Organization (WHO).

“What we signed is a step to revamp and also strengthen the Rwanda Foods and Drugs Authority. The money we will receive from the EU will support the acquisition of laboratory equipment to make it a modern facility that will enable Rwanda to get a WHO certification,” Ms Clare Akamanzi, Chief Executive Officer, Rwanda Development Board told CNBC Africa on Thursday.

“The WHO certification we need for this will also build the confidence of investors who want to produce vaccines. They (investors) will be able to trust the regulatory capacity we want to strengthen with this funding.”" 

What a misleading headline! 🤦🏾‍♂️

Folks, Please be careful!
A friend had his 2nd dose of the vaccine at the vaccination center and began to have blurred vision the whole way home.
When he got home, he called the vaccination center for advice and to ask if he should go see a doctor, or be hospitalized.
He was told to get back to the vaccination center immediately to take back his own glasses and return the glasses of the nurse he had taken mistakenly.

I also don’t expect a 1:1 mapping of athlete to technical official if we are to compete. All these sports require different attention

[10/07/2021, 14:13:26] ‪+256 774 988974‬: We need our athletes to go on track and field to participate without thinking of where they are going to get food, who is going to do their laundry, clean their stuff. Wake them up, make sure they are eating well

Embassy guys okay a role in getting them visas and maybe organizing their stay and maybe transportation. That’s the most they are supposed to do. They exist on a diplomatic mission and are an escalation point should anything happen to a citizen. Not to help with organizing sports events.
[10/07/2021, 14:26:07] Baguma Robert @: Do more research sir. This is Olympics they're representing Uganda not individual capacity

[10/07/2021, 14:37:51] Baguma Robert @: My argument isn't about whether they're recognized or not.   Send one or two official, the rest of logistics like food , laundry can handled by the embassy liaison officer. Its a matter of getting them accredited.
[10/07/2021, 14:38:25] Baguma Robert @: Unless if you say it's not Gov't of Uganda paying for the officials

[10/07/2021, 14:45:12] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Okay I hear you and like I said for me the only person that shouldn’t be there is maybe the Minister of State. But then Olympics is usually 2 weeks. These guys you want to be repurposed to do this job also have their day to day. And also the guys you want to be accredited will have to paid on our dimes. Are you l saying we go to Japan and get a japanase company  to cook for our athletes food maybe another  do their laundry because this can’t be embassy staff. Very expensive in the grand scheme of things.

[10/07/2021, 15:23:51] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Totally drifts away from the point I was trying to make but well. What I meant is this:
1. Athletes don’t bother themselves with speaking to organizers, the members of that committee do
2. The competitions have different setups, like heats or prequalifications,  etc and the committee is well aware of these setups and they have the briefs. No need to bother the athletes with these details except when they are needed.
3. These competitions usually happen sometimes at the same time over even different geographical areas. Team has to be specialized enough to handle this and handle the athletes as required

[20/07/2021, 14:54:06] ‪+256 774 988974‬: I’ve seen this article and it tends to answer some questions we actually had, but the writer actually falls short of giving his reasons because he hasn’t done lisaaaaach except for PTOs and has no closure whatsoever. For instance:
1. We didnt know that the top delegates are given a +1 by the Olympics so they can carry their spouses as long as they don’t pay them out allowances.
2. I like how the Boxing Federation eviscerates this whole PTO madness
3.Even if UG had only one person competing in the Olympics, there would still be about 10 officials going as a requirement by Olympics. 
4. One (1) team official for each discipline in which male athletes have been duly entered (maximum 44). Same for the women. 

Question from me would be what does discipline mean( because it for sure doesn’t mean categories)
Say for instance Athletics. This is huge, there are so many classifications under here and you cannot have a one size fits all coach.
4. Would have been nice if he closed his argument with some comparisons with some other countries to give context but unfortunately he falls short, no lisaaaaaaach

[11/08/2021, 09:50:39] ‪+256 772 532030‬: Your service record should be a source of pride not regret

By David F. K. Mpanga

Earlier this week, a brief report consisting of no more than three paragraphs and tucked away in the bottom right hand corner on Page Eight of this newspaper caught my eye. The headline that day was about the ground-breaking agreement by the East Africa Community leaders to build oil pipelines and a new Mombasa to Kigali railway line. This wasn’t major news by any stretch of the imagination, but I lingered over it because it struck a personal chord for me.

In 1976, my late father started suffering pain and other symptoms that caused him to seek for medical assistance. After being diagnosed and treated for various ailments without success, the doctors recommended more detailed investigations. The investigation options at Mulago hospital were limited; even the basic x-ray machine was broken down, or when it was working, there was no radiologist to operate it. So my father opted to seek treatment abroad.

I am reliably told by my mother that a medical referral was obtained and the necessary funds were raised. But there was one small hurdle. Treatment abroad had to be paid for in foreign currency and the foreign exchange controls that prevailed at the time meant that you needed the permission of the Minister of Finance to convert your local currency into foreign exchange. Without the minister’s permission, any dealings in foreign exchange were both illegal and extortionately expensive.

So my mother prepared the necessary paper work, got all of the bureaucratic clearances from the bank and the Ministry of Health then began hunting the Minister of Finance’s approval. On two or more separate occasions, the minister’s secretary advised my mother to go away and come back another day because the minister was in no mood to entertain her application. On the third or fourth time of checking at the minister’s office, the secretary told my mother that although the minister was engaged, he would see her if she could wait.

After a long and anxious wait during which she could hear the minister barking at somebody else over whatever matter had brought that poor soul to his office, my mother was summoned.

The minister, a no-nonsense military man, looked at her once over and asked what she wanted. He didn’t offer her a seat so she remained standing. She said she needed clearance to buy foreign exchange to pay for her husband’s medical treatment. She handed the minister the painstakingly collected and prepared paperwork. The minister cast his eye over the papers that had been handed to him and, without saying a word or asking any questions, tore them up and cast them in his waste paper basket.

My mother was dumbstruck. She wanted to plead with the man but couldn’t find the right words. She didn’t know whether it was wise or even safe for her to ask why the application had been rejected. With tears welling up in her eyes, the only words that came out of her mouth were “Thank you, sir”. The minister didn’t look up from his paperwork so my mother walked out of his office, closing the door behind her.

My father got progressively worse. A few months later, the doctors at Mulago, in desperation, decided to open up his abdomen to take a look at what they thought was a perennially obstructed gut. What they found was advanced cancer of the pancreas. There was nothing that they could do to save him so they stitched him up again. My father’s body, wracked with cancer, was too weak. He did not recover from the anaesthesia. He died post-operatively on December 10, 1976. He was 51-years-and-11-months old and I was six-years-old. He was buried in Masooli, which happens to be in Kyadondo East Constituency.

Pancreatic cancer is fairly aggressive and has a high mortality rate. But even in 1976, an earlier diagnosis could have led to treatment that would have prolonged my father’s life a little. That opportunity was missed thanks to the man who was then the Minister of Finance.

Leaving that to one side, the report that caught my eye was about the 2nd Deputy Prime Minister, General Moses Ali losing his temper in Parliament when the MP for Kyadondo East, Ibrahim Semujju Nganda, addressed him as a former minister of Finance under Idi Amin’s government. It was reported that the incident caused such a furore in the Chamber of Parliament that the Speaker was forced to adjourn the House prematurely.

Only the General knows why he took such offence at being reminded about his service record. Sadly, it’s too late to for him to change the past and I did not write this column for or about him. I have recounted this story as a salutary lesson for all those men and women who hold offices today in which they wield power over others. You can still save yourselves. Act lawfully, be fair and, above all, be humane so that in the future your service record may be a source of pride and joy and not a cause for bitter regret. People never forget

[27/08/2021, 06:44:52] Bukenya Ronald @: A tourist arrives in Mbarara town looking for a place to sleep. He gets into Lake View Hotel, slaps Ugx. 100k on the counter & heads straight upstairs to select a 3rd-floor room. Mr. Mugisha the cashier, grabs the 100k, dashes out to pay the butcher 100k for the meat supplied. The butcher rushes out to pay the goat farmer 100k for supplies. The farmer settles his 100k debt at the Vet shop. The Vet shopkeeper Sneaks out to pay 100k to Lake View Hotel & clears his debt for the rooms he used earlier that week. As he happily leaves for the door, the tourist returns downstairs & asks Mr. Mugisha for his 100k, stating he didn't like any of the rooms & will try elsewhere in town before dusk. As he takes back the money he has no idea how he has set everyone free of debt but no money has been left circulating in town... But at least, debts have been settled.

The Big Question is.... How do you explain that about 5 debts of 100k each was cleared by only 100k which in fact was never spent? Is this Accounting? Is it Economics? Or is it an illusion of Commerce?

Intellectuals, where are you?

[03/09/2021, 13:41:29] Tiano: GUN WEILDING GOONS KIDNAP VICTORIA UNIVERSITY VICE CHANCELLOR

Fear and shock engulfed Victoria University early today (2nd September 2021) when heavily armed gunmen raided the Kampala road based University and violently assaulted Dr. Lawrence Muganga (Vice Chancellor of Victoria University) and beat up his bodyguard before dragging them and bundling them into a waiting drone vehicle, and in the ensuing chaos, innocent University students and members of staff who dared to ask questions were roughed-up and beaten by the gun weilding goons.

The violent and high handed manner in which Dr. Lawrence Muganga was kidnapped  and disgraced in broad daylight amidst still unclear circumstances, leaves  alot to be desired as well as many unanswered questions;

 exactly what are the charges (if any)?, why would a civilian be arrested be violently descended on by the military? Why wasn't police involved? Where is he being held?, Why was he manhandled and mistreated? Why would  the security forces that arrested him, violate his rights in the wake of just a fortnight when the President cautioned security  forces against violating the human rights of Ugandans?

 If a Vice Chancellor can be mistreated, beaten up and humiliated by security forces, infront of his staff and students in broad daylight, what about if an ordinary Ugandan with no profile is arrested at night?

[21/09/2021, 14:57:52] ‪+256 782 025341‬: Robert Kabushenga (RK) speaks to Grace Makoko (GM) on Financial Planning.

RK: Good to have you Grace.

GM: It is a pleasure.

RK: The conversation about money is a hard one, sometimes people get carried away.  When some people get it they immediately spend it. What is that thing that happened to you that changed our approach to money?

GM: I am a product of a cross cultural union. My parents are from different cultures. Different tribes. My mum is from central. My father from western Uganda.

RK: Don’t go very far. My dad was from the extreme west in Kanungu and my mother from the extreme east on the foothills of Mt Elgon.

GM: Robert that’s not so bad, they were both from farming backgrounds. Mine, one was from a farming culture and the other from a pastoralist culture. Those two cultures look at wealth differently. A pastoralist stores his wealth in cattle. My dad wanted all his investment in cattle. While farmers understand the   value of land and property. The pastoralists are nomads by nature. This had a lot of challenges on their approach to building wealth.

The Kikuyus in Kenya also understand the value of land. When you are a farmer, land is everything. That influenced how my parents invested. There was more of tension.

I come from a polygamous family. Dad was very open about it. I am not ashamed of it. We grew up with my half siblings raised by my mother. My dad would always say “…tukaija Buganda kupagasa” we came to Buganda to work and take back home. But his taking it back home was to put it in the cattle. I will pause that one there.

My father was in the generation the colonial government handed power over to. He was in the queue at the right time. He was a civil servant. He was an Economist. Political parties at that time were along religious lines. UPC as for Protestants. And DP for Catholics. So my father was a “Nyamurunga person”. My dad loved Obote at heart.  We knew about Obote more that we knew about our blood relatives.

RK: What has that go to do with you and money?

GM: That’s the interesting part. Because my father was educated and a UPC support, we were the people in the thing as we say these days. We were loaded. My brother was on statehouse scholarship in an international school abroad. When we fell sick, we were taken abroad for treatment. Whenever we would be blocked on a roadblock, my dad had a card that he would show and we would   be waved on. There is no job my dad would never get you. He sat on so many boards. We were operating under what you could call the open heaven.

When I was joining S1, my shopping was done in Kenya. And this was not breaking news. We did that always. Even a basin was bought from Nairobi. These things you see today, we also did.

In 1986, everything changed.

RK: What happened?

GM: He didn’t plan. He never ever thought that their regime would ever be out of office. The signs came early in 1985 but he was too taken up to be cognisant of them. Along the way my mother had convinced him to put up something in Kampala but not much had come off it. He had an incomplete structure here in Kampala but more investments in the village.

When the government changed, we fell from up there to down, down, down. Seven years after the change of government, my dad died. He died of a broken heart. The change was too much.  More than he had ever imagined. It was too drastic.

My dad got cancer in his last days and the idea that he could stand in a line at Mulago hospital was unheard of. It was abominable. He couldn’t cope. He was no longer chauffeured. The Volvo and Peugeot had gone. He couldn’t pull any strings. President Museveni had brought in a new crop of leaders who had not been part of the previous governments.

RK: Let me get this well, Grace; you had this life of plenty and suddenly there was nothing and you had fallen to the bottom? And all this your dad had never anticipated?

GM: Robert, It was not even about money. My dad got me a place in Namagunga while I was in P7. But my mother preferred Gayaza and that is where I went. It was that change in access, influence and mind that you didn’t have to beg to get anything.  And he didn’t have a treasure trove. There was no plan.

RK: Grace, you are saying, there is many of us who get into jobs and get deceived that it will last  forever and we never look into the future? But also I guess, the other issue you are taking about from your mum is that we should pay attention to the things our partners are telling us. And the certain thing is that all the good life will end and you had better be ready with a financial backup. Is that what you are telling us?

GM: Correct. The person you are married to is supposed to complement you. If he had listened to her, they could have invested in property.

RK: Wait a minute Grace, what did your mum tell your dad?

GM: Here is the background story; my mum had got land from her dad. My mum was convincing him to buy more but at the time, Basajja ba Kabaka were not selling to non-Baganda. So she got her dad to convince Mzee Ssebugwaawo to get someone sell my dad land. But she had to be a signatory to the land. From that experience he was more reluctant to buy more. He had more wives and he didn’t find it viable buying land only in the name of one. That is why I brought in the idea of cross cultural unions. He only bought 10 acres. But with the kind of money he had, he could have bought more.

RK: Fast forward, you are broke, how does that change the way you think about money?

GM: From 86, it was a struggle. In high school at Gayaza, it was very hard. They would read names of girls to stay behind after the assembly and we knew what that meant. Fees defaulters. My sister and I regularly found ourselves on that list.

Good for me, I got a government sponsorship to join university but my younger siblings were affected. And dad used to tell us that education is a right not a luxury. Then there was all this shift. Robert, I worked. I worked in my s6 holiday to be able to get shopping for my university.

I had a cousin, James Mukanga who got me a job in s6 vacation at the Kampala Kindergarten. Mrs Mulumba always took on a Gayaza girl in s6 vacation. I didn’t take on work because I was a hard working girl or very brilliant at that, no. It’s because I had to work.

My dad died when I was in second year and all hell broke loose. The family patriarch had passed away.

I studied food science and technology.

RK: And you wound up in banking?

GM: Yes. So I finished in June 1995 and joined Standard Chattered in December. That year, the bank had had a fraud and fired about 23 people. When I came in, they just took us on. Even as I started work, I had only one ambition; that what happened to me would never happen to my children. So I had a rare focus. I understood the mantra of its better how you finish than how you start. I understood the mantra that is it better to look poor and be rich than look rich when you are poor. The middle class has a semblance of wealth but it is pseudo. What dad had was an appearance of wealth, but he was not wealth. It was just the aura. All my siblings were at Budo, Gayaza and Kisubi and dad would always get you a place there. From the first check I got at Stan Chart, I only had one mantra; store, store, store and invest.

By the way, it doesn’t have to be corruption money, we all have the Joseph years of plenty and scarcity. It comes to each one of us. We all get those opportunities. Time and chance happen to all men. If you get an opportunity you must maximise it. It will not be forever, things will change. I went into the job with that in mind. I had seen how my father had wasted his.

From my first cheque, I saved. Robert, I didn’t have car for the first seven years. I was using a taxi. But within those years I had a house and land.

RK: But you had a good choice of a husband in David Makoko. He is a good man.

GM: True. And I was going to hint on it. That who you marry also means a lot. David understood me but I guess he was also threatened I guess. We lived in austerity.

Robert I cooked on firewood. My brother fetched water from the well. That life was not for us. And this as not in Kyenjonjo, it was in Entebbe. We were able to make the transition.

I just had a sense of reality of what can happen to money if you do not respect it.

RK: Someone once said to me that money is like a visitor and how you treat a visitor will determine whether they want to stay or they want to leave.

GM: And I also strongly believe that anything you respect comes to you and anything you don’t respect goes away. My mother’s family has an appreciation for money. They respect money. They know that money has power. They understand that money gives you options.

You see Robert, today, if power goes off, some people go into a depression, and other people turn on a generator. Those are the options I’m talking about.

RK: For me I eve don’t know, I have my solar, I live off grid.  I want to ask you something about your principles on money. Austerity, what does it mean and how did you build this discipline to be aster.

GM: Robert, it all came from my father. He fell sick and I had to take him to hospital in a taxi. A person who had a driver and there he was in a taxi with the tout telling him, mzee semberayo.

RK: Oh no!

GM: My dad had been larger than life. But in his last days, we went to Mulago to line up for medicine. Those memories stayed with me. We agreed with my husband, David, on what we need to do. Budgets don’t work for my husband. But this whole thing of financial planning doesn’t work for many people. We agreed to save 60% of our income and live off 40. That was our plan. Tithe is part of our 60%. From the time we started our plan, we lived off our 40. The human mind is a good thing, if you tell yourself that you will live off 40% you live off that.

We lived within and below our means. By the time we moved to Nairobi as expatriates we were living off my fuel allowance. We had trained ourselves.

RK: Grace, you just punished David!

GM: By that time, we both appreciated where we were coming from. And by the way he is a better money manager than me. We would always swap. One month he would be in charge of money management and the next it would be me. By the end of his month, there would be more money left. By the end of my month there would be more month than money left.

Austerity is for times of plenty not of scarcity. You tighten the bet in the time of plenty. The bible talks about the ant. It stores up its food in summer for winter. You don’t store up for winter in winter. Austerity should come when you have a lot. Joseph told the people to bring a 1/5th of their harvest to Pharaoh. When the famine came, he went dishing out food. And that is the same as the African culture. They kept granaries. And they stored up in the time of plenty.

Dad had not done that. It took him to an early grave. He died at 58. I was only 21 at the time. Austerity is for the time of plenty.

There is a big difference to suffer because you have chosen. In 1986, we were not suffering out of choice, it was imposed on us. This one with my husband paid off brilliantly. We were suffering out of choice. We got to a point where I was not afraid of going to bed.

At the time dad died, he was asset rich but cash poor. He had land. But he had to liquidate to survive. At that time, he had to sell land to raise fees. It influenced the kind of investments David and I made. Invest in assets which have a cash flow so that they can give you money without having to liquidate.

RK: You invest in real estate for rental income or like me have a banana plantation, is that what you mean?

GM: Yes. But if you are going for rental, don’t go for a big house in Muyenga, have smaller houses. Go for lockups in markets. A lockup in Wandegeya market will give you better returns than idle land in Busiika.

Once you have the cash flow you can then go for the capital gains. They also say, don’t wait to buy land, buy land and wait because it will appreciate. The challenge with real estate is that the returns are too slow to breakeven. Kampala market takes 10- 12 years to breakeven on real estate. Dad had a bit of land in Tooro but never believed in selling it.

But I also worked towards a promotion at work and not a salary increase. Salary increments usually caters to inflation but not promotion. Promotion comes because of what you do outside your job description. You get a salary for doing your job description.

My entire working life, I wanted to be promoted. Couldn’t do a roll for more than four years. I aimed for promotion. At some point I figured that the good money was when you worked as an expatriate. For the ladies, having back to back babies does not work for your career and promotion. It might be your right. It doesn’t work towards promotion. Because I needed to earn, to be promoted. I never went for lunch. I was balancing being a mother, a wife and an employee. I was at office from 6:30am to 5:30pm.

RK: You wanted to build a reputation that you were this diligent worker?

GM: Yes. I always wanted to be on the list of the people to be promoted without any saying I had been favoured.

All this was motivated by what I had gone through. My father did not see the regime change coming. At the work place, you may never see the regime change coming. It’s subtle but sudden.

RK: it seems like it is sudden if you are not seeing the signs.

GM: my brother used to be a DJ and he would tell when a party was gaming out. If there is a company downsize is coming, you will tell. Don’t pretend like you don’t see covid and its effect on your workplace. Recalibrate. My dad underestimated the new regime. They came in wearing gumboots. They were poorly dressed. They were not as educated as him and his crop. But they had the last laugh.

RK: I had an experience of both. At one point I never knew my career in the corporate world would ever end. Seven or six years later, I started to realise that it was possible. And I began planning my exit.

Questions

Joy Batuusa: How did you get your children to understand and appreciate the sacrifices you had to make?

GM: I learnt from seeing from my parents. When the regime came everyone who was above 16, all the 19 of us never ever recovered. Also my mother made her mistakes. My children grew up in austerity. They didn’t have to understand. By the time they understood, it was the way of life.

Namuddu Grace: How was life after the early retirement?

GM: I didn’t choose to retire. The company downsized and I found myself on the list. We had an issue in the way we parted. But I was ready. I was prepared 5 years before. There was no panic.  There was not going to be change in lifestyle. The downsizing had started and I was an expensive hire. When you are not making money, you cut off expatriates. They are an expensive hire.

Let me tell you one thing we did with my husband. When you are an expatriate, the company pays fees for your children, together with my husband, we decided that we would continue to put away the fees money. We created a fees fund. We acted like we didn’t have the expatriate pack.

It is not easy though. Two things happen when you leave the corporate space. People introduce us by the titles of the places we worked.

RK: same thing happened to me. People were introducing me as the former CEO and I had to stop them. I am of the same quantity in my individual capacity. Always introduce me as me. Don’t tag things on the name.

GM: That loss of identity I guess is what affects many people. I guess it was the same thing with my dad.

The other thing is after the job, you have a lot of time. But that is for a season.

RK: I saw that coming. That is why I started out farming. There’s been no time I have been redundant.

GM: I had 4 years out of Uganda, I had kind of lost the network.

RK: Can you give us options of investments that blow off cash

GM: If it’s a business it is going to blow off cash flow at a certain point. If it is a government income you get dividends like a bond, banks now can give you your fixed account interests on a monthly basis, I talked about lockups, farming… it has to be something where you don’t have to liquidate it to get money off it.

RK: In other words, it is an asset which is put to use to make money. So if you have a car working as a taxi, so that it is not just a store of value.

GM: Yes. The caveat on that is that it should be in your area of influence. Your sphere of competence. It is assets that will blow off cash flow that you will go for.

RK: Where are you at in your life now?

GM: I turned 49 in July. Once I returned, I took out a 2 year sabbatical to just ask myself what I wanted to do with my life. I had the luxury of taking a sabbatical because I was financially independent. Then I went into financial markets consultancy. That has evolved and opened doors for me. I am extremely skilled in wholesale banking because I was very well trained. My children are now teenagers, and I have been investing in them. I had promised myself that if my youngest turned 10, I’d do a masters. My former employer valued experience over papers. So I was never under pressure to have one.  I finished my masters this month.

RK: Let me put it this way for you; you feel comfortable and in control of where you are!

GM: Yes. And I have an appreciation for geopolitics but also as an investor on why you shouldn’t stuck. There are so many opportunities in this country. For example every after 5 years we have elections but between year 3 and 4, there are so many opportunities.

RK: Give us your last message on money. Something for a take away.

GM: If you don’t remember anything have said today, remember these two:

To manage money, to create wealth, you must have two important qualities;
You must be intentional i.e. have discipline. Don’t allow life to happen to you.
Be patient. Don’t act like this job or day of life? That is the difference between the people who came before 1986 and those who came after. They are intentional and patient.
RK: Grace, I am so grateful, you agreeing to spend time with me.

GM: You are welcome. It was an honour and a privilege to speak to the people.

RK: I will pray to God to bless you.

[16/11/2021, 11:55:50] Ainomugisha Solomon @: Situation Update from NECOC team

- 6 confirmed dead including 2 police officers
- 8 confirmed injuries 
- more verification being done on number of injured
- 1 more bomb discovered at the transformer of Kooki Tower opp CPS and has been detonated.
- 2 more bombs discovered near Buganda Road court.
- Police Counter Terrorism doing their best to locate bombs and detonate.

This seems a planned syndicate of terror and possibility of more bombs planted around strategic locations and critical facilities possible. 

So please let’s all keep vigilant and avoid unnecessary movements.

[25/11/2021, 06:04:11] ‪+256 761 783893‬: Last Friday, I took a guest to an Indian restaurant (name withheld) in the city, courtesy of my love for their juicy well-marinated chicken tika, roti, nan and pan. I noticed that a waiter had a spoon in his shirt pocket. Looking around, i saw all the waiters had spoons in their pockets.

When our waiter came I inquired, "Why do you place the spoon in your pocket?" 

He explained, "The boss hired a Consulting firm (name withheld) to re-engineer our processes. They discovered the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil; Approximately 3 spoons per table per hour are dropped, and concluded that if our staff carry spoons, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift." 

As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he replaced it with his spare one.

"I'll get another spoon for my pocket next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now." 

I was impressed.

I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the  waiter's zip. Looking around, I saw that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their zips. Pointing to his string, I asked the waiter, "Excuse me, can you tell me why you have that string there?"

The waiter moved closer and in a lowered voice said, "Wow! Not everyone is so observant! The Consultants also suggested we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of our manhood, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 45%."

I asked in an equally lowered voice, "After you get it out, how do you put it back?"

He whispered, "The Consultants did not mention that in the report, so we use the spoon."

[12/12/2021, 17:53:42] ‪+256 774 988974‬: We are throwing NRM, Bobi Wine in all this

[12/12/2021, 17:55:00] ‪+256 782 025341‬: ahhhh okay. kale go on
[12/12/2021, 17:55:05] ‪+256 782 025341‬: 😃
[12/12/2021, 17:55:41] ‪+256 778 837112‬: 😂😂😂😂 so the race director has the tear gas
[12/12/2021, 17:55:47] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Race director is supposed to apply the rules not change them as he sees fit
[12/12/2021, 17:57:11] Baguma Robert @: Does this reverse the results?
[12/12/2021, 17:57:13] ‪+256 782 025341‬: Then why do you have a director if its that obvious?🙄
[12/12/2021, 17:57:38] ‪+256 782 025341‬: Naye wabula olwanye😂😂😂🙌
[12/12/2021, 17:57:57] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Depends on what the remedy is
[12/12/2021, 17:58:07] ‪+256 782 025341‬: But what rule did he change?😃
[12/12/2021, 17:58:55] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Come on man it’s like saying why do we have the judicial system aka judges. They are there to interpret the law not make the laws
[12/12/2021, 17:59:50] ‪+256 782 025341‬: Thank you. To *interprete*. Thats the key word. He has interpreted..kati why the fuss?😃
[12/12/2021, 17:59:55] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Again read up there my guy. I’ve posted twice 

“Once the LAST lapped car has passed the leader the safety car will return to the pits at the end of the FOLLOWING lap.”
[12/12/2021, 18:00:26] ‪+256 774 988974‬: He didn’t interpret them correctly which is why Mercedes is appealing
[12/12/2021, 18:00:56] Baguma Robert @: Do you frankly believe  championship will be  taken from max to Lewis?
[12/12/2021, 18:00:58] ‪+256 782 025341‬: The most important thing is the race stewards *interpretation* .
[12/12/2021, 18:01:11] ‪+256 782 025341‬: Correctly according to who? Redbull or Mercedes ??
[12/12/2021, 18:01:32] ‪+256 774 988974‬: I’m not saying anything. We will hear what the outcome is
[12/12/2021, 18:01:55] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Even you can read the rules and see what the rules are.
[12/12/2021, 18:02:05] ‪+256 774 988974‬: You don’t need anyone to interpret for you
[12/12/2021, 18:02:16] ‪+256 782 025341‬: The issue is that your also viewing this from a mercedes fan point of view. So you wll naturally be biased and assume the director is incompetent
[12/12/2021, 18:02:42] ‪+256 774 988974‬: The rules have nothing to do with point of view
[12/12/2021, 18:03:04] ‪+256 774 988974‬: You out to do better than this my guy
[12/12/2021, 18:03:07] ‪+256 782 025341‬: But you also. Then why do we need the director to interprete then? olaba bwetwetolola 😂😂😂
[12/12/2021, 18:03:27] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Why do we have a referee in football
[12/12/2021, 18:04:09] ‪+256 782 025341‬: I thought yo supposed to convince me to see yo point and me to beleive that the director doesnt know what he is doing
[12/12/2021, 18:04:09] ‪+256 782 025341‬: 😃
[12/12/2021, 18:05:03] ‪+256 782 025341‬: but lets move on. we both just fans with lugezigezi. thats all😂😂😂🙌
[12/12/2021, 18:05:26] Baguma Robert @: What do you believe will happen
[12/12/2021, 18:06:57] ‪+256 774 988974‬: I don’t know how those things are interpreted but whatever happens will happen. Ofcourse highly unlikely Max will lose championship just like it was highly unlikely for him to win it
[12/12/2021, 18:08:30] ‪+256 782 025341‬: 🙄👀

[12/12/2021, 18:14:13] ‪+256 778 837112‬: this is the first season in a long while for the abhu dabhi race to actually even matter
[12/12/2021, 18:14:25] ‪+256 774 988974‬: I’m not basing on season, I’m basing on race
[12/12/2021, 18:14:25] ‪+256 778 837112‬: usually the season is dead by this time
[12/12/2021, 18:14:56] ‪+256 774 988974‬: They had the better all season thanks to the rule change which impacted Low Rake
[12/12/2021, 18:15:38] ‪+256 774 988974‬: But Mercedes aka Lewis fought back and he’s won 3 in a row all fairly even with dirty driving from Max
[12/12/2021, 18:16:01] ‪+256 774 988974‬: So again never about how you start but rather how you finish
[12/12/2021, 18:16:09] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Applies in every sport
[12/12/2021, 18:17:11] ‪+256 774 988974‬: But in any case I already congratulated Max and the FIA
[12/12/2021, 18:17:23] ‪+256 774 988974‬: For the championship won together
[12/12/2021, 18:19:24] Baguma Robert @: One could say the same thing about today's race
[12/12/2021, 18:20:06] ‪+256 773 278450‬: Define dirty driving? 
Y’all
Must understand that aggressive driving is a racing style

[12/12/2021, 18:20:54] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Aggressive, speak to Charles and other other drivers
[12/12/2021, 18:22:10] ‪+256 778 837112‬: and are those other drivers champions today ?
lack of aggression is why Bottas is very low in the standings yet he has a very strong car
[12/12/2021, 18:22:12] Baguma Robert @: Kasta  he is now 2021 champion
[12/12/2021, 18:22:42] Baguma Robert @: The  bottas have nothing
[12/12/2021, 18:23:10] ‪+256 778 837112‬: u forget what Lewis did to Charles  and Albon
[12/12/2021, 18:24:09] ‪+256 778 837112‬: some level of aggressiveness is required
[12/12/2021, 18:25:14] ‪+256 778 837112‬: when Vettel lost it he also lost his seat coz the youngster had more of it
[12/12/2021, 18:27:19] ‪+256 773 278450‬: 💯💯💯💯💯
[12/12/2021, 18:28:53] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Anyways we are digressing to other discussion. Now we are talking about aggression with no supporting information. Season is done. Last race didn’t deserve this  much drama and controversy.
[12/12/2021, 18:29:38] ‪+256 774 988974‬: I would pick Charles over Max any day. He’s a better all round driver
[12/12/2021, 18:31:08] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Lewis battle with Perez is what racing is. Mature and aggressive but not forced
[12/12/2021, 18:39:38] ‪+256 782 025341‬: what does *better* mean in this case?
[12/12/2021, 18:41:11] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Give Charles an  Adrian Newey car like the one Max had this season, championship would have been wrapped up a long time ago

[12/12/2021, 19:00:06] ‪+256 774 988974‬: It says “All cars overtaken by the leader “
[12/12/2021, 19:00:31] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Massi can decide whether overtaking should happen or not

[12/12/2021, 19:02:17] ‪+256 774 988974‬: With a call from Redbull in between 56 and 57 asking why lapped cars won’t overtake
[12/12/2021, 19:06:23] Baguma Robert @: Lapped cars have always been allowed . Not sure why you guys are whining . The only controversial decision would be why they weren't being allowed
[12/12/2021, 19:06:41] Baguma Robert @: If you're looking at precedent
[12/12/2021, 19:09:41] ‪+256 774 988974‬: That’s not the presence here. Lapped cars not lapping was actually at his discretion which he made at lap 56. But allowing only the cars in between Max and Lewis and not the rest yet they were close by and also the rule is safety car only comes in after the lapped cars have caught up
[12/12/2021, 19:10:40] Baguma Robert @: I see.
[12/12/2021, 19:11:21] Baguma Robert @: The issue you have you wanted the race to end a safety car
[12/12/2021, 19:11:30] Baguma Robert @: With*
[12/12/2021, 19:11:33] Baguma Robert @: Lewis wins
[12/12/2021, 19:11:47] ‪+256 782 025341‬: Okay, but now just allow. 😂😂😂
[12/12/2021, 19:12:37] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Not necessarily. He would have left the cars not to lap. But then Max would have to fight for his win by passing the 5 cars in between
[12/12/2021, 19:13:00] ‪+256 774 988974‬: And those were going to be blue flags
[12/12/2021, 19:13:31] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Would have made for a better ending even a race to finish line
[12/12/2021, 19:15:35] Baguma Robert @: Hehehe...why would you want  lapped cars be used a pawn in the championship ?
[12/12/2021, 19:16:01] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Like I said they would get blue flags
[12/12/2021, 19:16:46] ‪+256 774 988974‬: So decision was either let them race under those conditions or finish under a safety car. We all wanted race but then he customized how he wanted the race to be
[12/12/2021, 19:17:51] Baguma Robert @: Oba which race have you ever watched where lapped cars are part of safety car  restarts ?
[12/12/2021, 19:19:09] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Now you are talking. Again decision for lapped cars has to be in full not partial. And under Wet conditions lapped cars are sometimes not allowed
[12/12/2021, 19:19:38] Baguma Robert @: Do you see any wet conditions today
[12/12/2021, 19:20:39] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Again allowing lapped cars to pass is at the discretion of the race director when he considers it SAFE
[12/12/2021, 19:20:53] ‪+256 774 988974‬: So he can decide not to let them through
[12/12/2021, 19:21:22] Baguma Robert @: Are you saying it wasn't safe ?
[12/12/2021, 19:21:33] ‪+256 774 988974‬: I don’t know if you were listening to Massi on the radio. That’s the reason he gave Redbull. That the track wasn’t safe
[12/12/2021, 19:22:01] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Not me, Michael Massi
[12/12/2021, 19:22:13] ‪+256 774 988974‬: The Race Director

[12/12/2021, 21:20:18] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Again this decision just simply shows the direction the F1 is taking. They were not going to take away an undeserved win from their golden boy and piss off the millions of fans they’ve got

[13/12/2021, 05:46:06] Baguma Robert @: Hehehe...Once you take the route of  protesting that means you're invoking the legalities .  Usually legalities  is never about popularity opinion but about what the law says and its interpretation.   More so if you/Mercedes feel dissatisfied there is next  layer of appeal  called international court of arbitration .  One thing I can tell you Max is crown isn't going away . 
You niggas forget easily in  jeddah you guys argued the law says formation lap not stop start lap mbu car length.

[13/12/2021, 09:58:14] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Boss man the stewards are F1 , so F1 investigated itself and gave a judgement
[13/12/2021, 10:09:38] Baguma Robert @: Strategy is a betting game . You can come from hero to zero very fast . Mercedes betted on track position and it backfired.
[13/12/2021, 10:10:26] Baguma Robert @: Point of  correction.. Stewards are FIA not F1 employees
[13/12/2021, 10:10:50] ‪+256 774 988974‬: And F1 is what
[13/12/2021, 10:12:13] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Yesterday was nothing to with strategy and if that’s what you think go back and watch the race when Max pitted for fresh tyres under the VSC
[13/12/2021, 10:13:29] Baguma Robert @: In English sir ... stewards are appointed by Bank of uganda(FIA)  though banks/F1 is under BOU.
[13/12/2021, 10:15:04] Baguma Robert @: It has to do with strategy old hard rubber versus soft tyres . Do you think if he had new soft rubber max would have chewed him ?
[13/12/2021, 10:15:46] Baguma Robert @: It was a bet gone wrong...
[13/12/2021, 10:15:49] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Max wouldn’t have even pitted and race would have ended under safety car regulations

[13/12/2021, 10:18:51] ‪+256 774 988974‬: And who is the employer of the Race Director ??
[13/12/2021, 10:19:54] Baguma Robert @: Are you sure Max wouldn't have pitted? Even I without the data , it was obvious that Max was going to pit under any safety car . It was even common sense that Mercedes wouldn't pit to give up track position.
[13/12/2021, 10:20:11] Baguma Robert @: FIA
[13/12/2021, 10:23:57] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Max was told to do the opposite. Go back and listen to team radios. And after seeing the duel between Lewis and Perez it was a fair decision not to sacrifice track position. The Redbull was setup for straight line speed yesterday
[13/12/2021, 10:25:03] ‪+256 774 988974‬: So in short FIA (Stewards) investigated itself (Director) and found itself not guilty
[13/12/2021, 10:25:56] Baguma Robert @: Mzee go and study the sports appeal process.
[13/12/2021, 10:26:33] Baguma Robert @: It's a clear process for any aggrieved party whether it's tennis

[13/12/2021, 10:29:31] ‪+256 774 988974‬: In football do we always agree with every decision that VAR makes. NO
[13/12/2021, 10:31:03] Baguma Robert @: If you aren't happy with VAR, you  will appeal to FA . If you aren't happy with FA ruling ... you appeal to CAS
[13/12/2021, 10:31:24] Baguma Robert @: That's way football politics works
[13/12/2021, 10:31:37] Baguma Robert @: Or sports politics work

[13/12/2021, 10:40:57] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Why is Mercedes so fussy about this whole thing. I don’t think this starts just yesterday
[13/12/2021, 10:42:12] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Try to go back and listen to the radio messages between Redbull and the Race Director and compare that with Mercedes and Race Director. 
As soon as I heard Massi tell Redbull give me a second. That’s when I knew this was over

[13/12/2021, 10:49:21] Baguma Robert @: Not sure your obsessions with radios ... I am hoping you're aware not everything between FIA and teams is being given to us .  The f1 guys take a few radio message and broadcast them to us . The same way not all radio between driver and team is being broadcasted  to us . With that said that means the analysis with such messages is shallow at its best
[13/12/2021, 10:49:57] Baguma Robert @: It's like quoting sky guys
[13/12/2021, 10:50:39] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Sky chooses what to broadcast to us but the obvious messages and contentious ones are usually broadcast for transparency

[13/12/2021, 11:00:22] ‪+256 774 988974‬: That’s why they have specific pundits listening to the radios that keep updating us about things we haven’t even heard

I want you to do a simple google search of the top 10 richest people...they all have 1 thing in common. They went to good schools. Education is a tool, of you use your tool well you can get rich. It's also a gamble, you can take your kid to the best schools and they want to be DJs (and that's ok).

[07/01/2022, 11:55:57] ‪+256 774 988974‬: Very very hard truths in there if you get the message. What this guy is saying isn’t that we shouldn’t take our kids to Gayaza, Budo, Smack that are paying the fees they are paying. We should know our levels. If you can afford, there shouldn’t be a problem. Are you going to bury yourself in debt because you need the kids to go to these schools, which are actually not a guarantee to anything in life. The reason some parents get depressed is not realizing this “return on investment”

The top 10 rich people you talk of all grew up in rich families or even those with generational wealth. They didn’t go to Harvard on loans

‎[07/01/2022, 12:00:36] Baguma Robert @: ‎sticker omitted
[07/01/2022, 12:17:36] ‪+971 50 860 2994‬: It's a gamble, one I think is worth taking. Alot of people take loans to attend Harvard etc..not because these places teach rocket science, but because these schools can provide you with a network/alumnus of very highly connected, influential and rich people who can propel you to where you want to be. Your network determines your net worth. The older I get..the more this statement resonates with me.
[07/01/2022, 12:31:36] ‪+256 774 988974‬: I agree but that doesn’t come from you the father, the undertaking and passion comes from your child, which is something you should be able to see with time. But then this guy is  talking about our systems here. But if we are talking out there, college is very expensive not only for the Ivy League colleges. It’s almost impossible to attend without students taking debt or being on scholarships. Credit system is well structured out there. 

What that guy was trying to bring to context is here in our 3rd world countries
I will take that loan if my kid shows passion and has interest  in undertaking some skills which will be relevant in the future. 
Let networking supplement your child’s skills

Now, every once in a while, and especially as you learn to develop this attitude, a woman 
might tell you that she loves you. And if you say, "I love you too", then you're fucked! 
You might as well chop off your dick and hand it to her..... Remember: He who loves 
least controls the relationship. I have only said, "I love you" to two women in my life. I 
married them both. I tell them, "I’ll tell you that I love you when I’m putting a ring on 
your finger.”

BJ: 
This morning, the cabinet concluded that the booster campaign, together with the way how the public responded to the plan B, measures, we can return to plan A, and allow plan B to expire.
As a result from the start of Thursday next week:
-mandatory certification will end;
-organisations can of course choose to use the NHS COVID-19 pass voluntarily; but 
-we will end the compulsory use of Covid-19 certification in England.
-From now on the government is no longer asking people to work from home;
-People should speak to their employers on how to return to office;
-Once regulations lapse, the government will no longer require wearing of face masks anywhere;
-From tomorrow (Thursday) No face masks in classrooms and communal areas 
-No more criminalising for not wearing face masks;
-Ease restrictions to care houses

A wealthy Nigerian aristocrat was hosting a party at his estate, which had been in his family for generations. 

He noticed that one of his guests bore a striking resemblance to himself. 

He could not believe that such a similarity could exist with no genetic link, so guessing that his father had sown some wild oats, he approached the guest and asked with a smirk, 

"Was your mother ever a maid here?". 

The guest replied, "No, my father used to be the gardener."

....That's how the fight started....🤣

On their way back home, he said to his child: May I never see you steal again, otherwise I will burn your hands.  Look, because of you we have become poor again.  The little one replies with a smile: Don't cry, dad.  The money you paid, here it is.  I stole it from the desk drawer before going out.*

  *QUESTIONS:*

 If you are the father of this child, what will you do?
 1 .  Punish him ?
 2 .  Bring him back to jail?
 3 .  Congratulate him?
 4. Return the money?
