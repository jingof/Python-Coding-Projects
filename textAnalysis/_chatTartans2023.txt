It is for that department of ECE.

As mentioned earlier, MSIT have to come up with their own research problem statements and have a proposal. You can definitely look through these research projects to get inspiration for your original research idea for MSIT research. Also, this would help you know different research interest areas of professors at CMU Africa.

I hope this helps?

[28/08/2021, 20:16:23] Baby: Check their letters and register to the corresponding letter.
[28/08/2021, 20:20:08] ‪+229 66 26 94 81‬: What I’m saying is that I want to register for two different letters of the same item.
‎[28/08/2021, 20:20:21] Baby: ‎image omitted
[28/08/2021, 20:21:04] Baby: Then search the number twice and register for each letter
[28/08/2021, 20:21:27] Baby: I guess it's the same process...
[28/08/2021, 20:23:42] ‪+229 66 26 94 81‬: There will be no conflict ? 
Cause I’m going to drop a course (which is currently full) to attempt that registration. If it fails there may not be no way back cause for the mean time someone in waitlist may have replaced me in the course I dropped 😂😂😂
[28/08/2021, 20:27:26] Baby: May be @2348109250377 can explain. But I think you can register as many 04-800s as you want. Unless the course you're attempting to register is also full.

[22/09/2021, 17:20:12] Courage Ekoh CMU: Hello ASP students, 

Apologies for the hiccups with Assignment 1 submission. 

Gradescope has been reviewed and you can now make two separate submissions for the written part  and the coding part.

The written part can be submitted as a PDF document with selections made for the appropriate  pages on gradescope. The coding part should be an ipynb file that is zipped. Essentially, you submit a zipped document for the coding. 

You may also make a canvas submission as well for redundancy.

3 students have submitted. We encourage you to make your submission again to ensure it conforms to the new guidelines. 

Apologies again.

[30/09/2021, 08:48:36] Ayobami CMU Esther: Dear Tartans,


Today, the 30th of September 2021, we happily and joyously join with our fellow Tartans from Botswana as they celebrate their 55th independence day. Botswana, before independence in 1966, was a British protectorate called Bechuanaland. The name was inspired by the dominant ethnic group presently known as Tswana but previously spelled as Bechuana.


Botswana, "Land of the Tswana," is a semi-desert; consequently, rain is highly valorized, their currency is the "Pula," meaning rain or blessing in Tswana, and their language is Setswana. Botswana houses the largest concentration of African elephants and has the largest inland delta called Okavango Delta in the world. Botswana is presently the leading country with a world record for the largest diamonds, and she uses her diamond revenue to subsidize education.


As a community that shares in each other's pain and joy, let us endeavor to reach out to our fellow Batswana and felicitate with them as they celebrate this prestigious day and a significant landmark in their history.


Happy Independence Day.



Pula Pula Pula. 

The Tartans Community Celebrates You.




Best regards,

International Student Affairs Ministry (The Student Guild)

[01/10/2021, 08:41:46] Ayobami CMU Esther: Dear Tartans,

Arise, O Compatriots

Nigeria's call obey!  

Happy Independence Day to all our fellow Tartans from Nigeria on the occasion of their 61st independence!

Nigeria is officially named the Federal Republic of Nigeria and is popularly known as the "Giant of Africa" owing to its economy and large population; it is the 7th most populated country globally. 

Nigeria is a diverse multi-ethnic country with 36 states and more than 520 spoken languages: Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba being the major languages. Nigeria is also rich in many natural resources, with oil being one of the country's biggest exports.

Her independence day is observed as a national holiday across the country. On this day, the government and the people honor the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to free the country from the colonizers by hoisting the national flag and singing the national anthem.



We cannot end this without a shoutout to Nigeria's music industry and some of its famous music exports, such as the $30 billion gang, Wizkid, and the mighty Burnaboy (the Grammy winner, oh yes!). 

Enjoy this playlist of some of Nigeria's top songs over the past few months in celebration of Nigeria's independence. Our top pick for today is Squander by Falz!
Squander - Falz
Duduke - Simi
“Geng” - Mayorkun
In My Maserati - Olakira 

Finally, a classic throwback: Standing Tall Nigerian 100 Years Celebration Song (2013)

As a closely knitted community, let us endeavor to reach out to our fellow Nigerians and felicitate with them as they celebrate this prominent day and a significant landmark in their history.

PS: If you see a Nigerian today, ask them: "Oh boy, how far? Why everybody just dey "japa" like this? Make sapa enjoy small now! 

Happy 61st independence celebration 

The Tartans community celebrates you.

Best regards,

Learners Crib, International Student Affairs Ministry (The Student Guild)

The Data Science Club invites you to today's club meeting by 2pm where we will be discussing improving your machine learning models using 'the hacks of the trade'. Given that there will be a hackathon (with pretty cool prizes) at the end of the month, this is a session that simply cannot be missed!

We look forward to seeing you.

[02/10/2021, 09:13:45] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Re: The Feedback Form

Simply saying 'we need help' on the feedback form does not help me and the committee know what to do😂. Do you need help with food during the class? Or breaks? Or the teaching style? As the Zen of Python goes *Explicit is better than Implicit*. Please be as explicit as possible.


Also, I had someone drop a course recommendation on a course I know not so many CMU-Africa students are looking to take. If you are taking a Pittsburgh course and you are enjoying it, feel free to name-drop the course and maybe add why you think other students should consider taking it. 


Thank you all for the feedback so far. ☺️

I read every feedback personally so be sure proper attention will be paid to every thing you write (even if it is the length of an essay 😄). Thanks for sharing your concerns.

Please don't forget the Women in Tech meeting today. We are discussing why we need women in technology. We are going to have games, discussions, reflections and resolution.
4pm -5pm CAT

https://cmu.zoom.us/j/93924738093?pwd=Wmo2d1o1ZWV5UTF4NWZ4dlFDdHpvdz09
[02/10/2021, 12:43:28] Ayobami CMU Esther: Dear All,

Do you know that only 5% of women in the world are programmers? Do you also know that less than 3% of women are Nobel Prize Laureates?

Join the Women in Tech  Club today during our bi-monthly club meeting by 4 pm CAT to discuss why we need women in Tech.
This program is part of our motivation in October, where we hope to strengthen each other and work together to bridge the gender divide in technology. 

We can promise you that the program will be entertaining, interactive, and packed with lessons. You cannot afford to miss it. Men with an interest in women in Tech can also attend.
We look forward to seeing you.

[09/10/2021, 11:32:02] Ayobami CMU Esther: Dear Tartans,

Happy Independence Day to all our fellow Tartans from Uganda on the occasion of their 59th independence!
Uganda has the world's youngest population and one of the world's longest-serving presidents (President Yoweri Museveni, who came to power in 1986).

Lake Victoria is the world's largest lake, the second-largest freshwater lake globally, and the largest lake in Ugandan.
The capital of Uganda is Kampala, and Kampala is nicknamed "City of  Seven Hills." The main languages in Ugandan are Luganda, English(Official language), and Swahili. Baganda, Banyankole, and Basoga are the Three major ethnic groups in Uganda, and their favorite foods are Matoke, Luwombo, and Chapati.

As a community that shares in each other's pain and joy, let us endeavor to reach out to our fellow Ugandans and felicitate with them as they celebrate this prestigious day and a significant landmark in their history.

Happy Independence Day.
The Tartans Community Celebrates You.

Best regards,
Learners Crib, International Student Affairs Ministry (The Student Guild)

Hey mates, in case you missed the email.
*Patricia Musiime* is our new _Career Services Officer_ and she would like to hear from us.

Hi All,

Hope you are all doing well and keeping safe.

With delight, I wish to express my excitement to join the CMU-Africa community.

As a new member to the Student Affairs Team and specifically Career Services, I would like to take some time next week  to hear from you and how best I can support you for all your career needs. I will be setting up a few slots next week to basically meet and I get insights of what you'd like for us to focus on around Career Services related offerings throughout the AY 2021/22.

Because you all can't make it at the same time due to your class schedules, I have scheduled for 4 different slots (Tuesday & Wednesday) please book a slot that works best for you. I will send calendar invites with a zoom link to those that will have RSVPed.

Please use the link below to book your slots.

[12/10/2021, 12:07:32] Ayobami CMU Esther: Dear DIAML Students

There are still many students who have not set up the LockDown Browser, slightly less than half of the students in the class have managed to do so. If you have not set up the LockDown Browser, please do so as early as possible so that the TAs can find ways to assist you in case you encounter an issue. For those students who encountered challenges during the set up process and managed to resolve these issues, please make a post on Piazza on how you went about it. This could be very helpful to other students who might face the same challenges whilst setting up the LockDown Browser.

Please note that setting up the LockDown Browser is part of examination preparation. If your LockDown Browser is not set up you will not be able to access the examination. The stress of taking an exam is a lot as it stands, now imagine that coupled with the stress of not being able to access the examination. You don't want to be in this situation on the day of the examination so please set up the LockDown Browser as soon as possible and take the test quiz to ensure everything is set up correctly.

Please find the link to take the test quiz on piazza. The password for the test quiz is:  DiamlQuiz1


Please email all the TAs if you are encountering any challenges with setting up the Respondus LockDown Browser. 

Best wishes for the exam.

TAs

There will a live voting session for some of the awards so come cheer/vote for your favorite club(s) and stand the chance to win for yourself vubavuba vouchers 😁.

Dear Tartan,

TLDR: Provide specific feedback to your TAs here - https://forms.gle/MBja3ep4Nh99p7mM8. Check SIO for your midterm grades and please reach out if there are worrying signs.

Congratulations on finishing the first half of the semester. We are excited that the second half has commenced. As improvement cannot happen without feedback, we request that you provide feedback for all your TAs here.The form can be filled multiple times for different courses. As much as possible, let your feedback be specific to a TA. You can have several paragraphs for the different TAs.

As we have crossed the mid-semester mark, CMU encourages faculty to release a mid-semester grade that serves as a health check (for full semester courses). This grade does not affect your final grade. It is just to let you know what you are likely to earn in the course given how you have performed so far. It is in your interest to check what those grades are on SIO.

If your midterm grades are great, it is not time to rest yet. Keep up the good work. If the midterm grades are not as encouraging, you should not be too discouraged. You definitely can improve it by a great deal. If you need help with improving your grades, please reach out so that we can get you the help that you need. We are here to support you.

I wish you a successful second half of the semester.

Best wishes,
Adebayo.

That is your works correctly on your local machine and fails only on Gradescope, for q3a.

I hope this email finds you well. I would like to request your collaboration in this important activity that is beneficial for both the students and administration. As we are starting the second half of the semester, we would like to get feedback from you on the support you received so far in the Fall 21 semester. This mid semester survey  will include the different aspects from academic support, administrative and student organizations. It may take between 7-12 minutes of your time. Your valuable insights into what is going well and not so well will help us make adjustments wherever possible.

I have it on authority that there will be a raffle for vuba vuba vouchers. Fill the survey to enter.
[24/10/2021, 20:24:32] ‪+250 784 497 034‬: Vuba vuba is very important especially in these times of stochastic process course. 
In the bible Paul said there will be difficulty times. And I am surprised Stochastic is the perfect trigger of this time the man of God had been saying.

Our heart goes out to our community from Sudan on the recent military coup in the country, leading to tension, violence, arrest of the leaders, and the shutdown of their airport, hospitals, and internet.

We will like to comfort you with the word that the world is watching, and the US, EU, UN, and Arab League are also aware, which we believe might lead to light at the end of the tunnels in the coming days.

These are trying times, and as a community united through diversity, let us stand firm for one another, especially for our members from Sudan. Remember, an injury to one is an injury to all. And to this, we say, you are not alone, my fellow Sudanese, We stand with you.

Best regards,

[30/10/2021, 09:50:55] Adebayo EniOluwafe: As more and more machine learning models are being deployed in real world scenarios, Machine Learning in Production (MLOps) is becoming a required toolkit for every machine learning engineer and data scientist. Gone are the days when knowing how to use Jupyter notebooks for machine learning analysis alone are enough! This week, the Data Science Club will be going through the important components of MLOps and how to get started. Adebayo will be taking us through writing clean code for machine learning projects, the concept of reproducibility using Scikit-learn pipeline module, among other things. Join us by 2pm today!

Allow people make videos from their house in front of their computers and say stuff like "Community to me is sitting in front of my computer for 16hrs a day, attending zoom lectures, dying with assignments, and forgetting to eat. Oh, community means something different? Then I don't know what community means" 🌚

[01/11/2021, 10:07:00] Courage Ekoh CMU: Maybe students can talk about the reality of experiencing no community in the last year, and how they hope community day will be a change force going forward. Other than that, I don't think there's any video to make

[01/11/2021, 10:52:04] Kelvin Kamande cmu: Yeah ... 😅😅 let's say what has been our reality ... now here is the silver lining .... for instance, you play football for connection on weekends...how about you invite people to play football this community day with you?? 

I play fifa for connection... I definitely would love to invite people to play it this community day??? 😂😂😂 

It's a community day and inviting people to stay in their house and connect on zoom because that is what you have been doing in the past doesn't add up. 

Or maybe I am missing the point here 🥲🥲🥲

[06/11/2021, 11:45:21] Ayobami CMU Esther: Dear Tartans,

Yesterday was a Black Friday for some members of our community. We are sad to announce a fuel tanker explosion in Sierra Leone last night with hundreds of people dead, including relatives of students in our community.

Currently, over 84 bodies have been recovered and still counting. We sympathize with members of our community severely affected by this, and please know that you are in our prayers.

We’re sending you love and comfort, and we implore the student community to do the same because these are difficult times, and we need each other. We pray that the souls of the departed rest in perfect peace.

The Academic Advisor, Olga, is championing a discussion by 12.50pm today on Time Management as a CMU student. 

The meeting invite has been sent since Tuesday I think. The meeting is highly informal, more like an idea-sharing/ 
brainstorming session so I believe it is an excellent learning opportunity.

[13/11/2021, 07:17:49] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I've always been passionate about the academic wellbeing of others, and that is why I'm applying for the position of *Academics and Research Minister*.

As a student, I've witnessed firsthand the terrible effects of a lack of assistance on students, I feel passionately about knocking down the barriers that are often stopping student from achieving their academic aspirations. Personally, I’ve dealt with several hurdles, from extenuating circumstances to lack of resources. I was fortunate enough to have exceptional advice and guidance. However, I know this not the case for some students, who are frequently let down. 

I will work to ensure all students have constant academic support and guidance. 

Education isn’t about home student’s vs international students, MSIT vs MSECE, it is about creating a united student body, and that is where my focus will be.

Vote *DEJI  ADEBAYO* as the Academic and Research minister and you will see your studies and voice at the center of everything I do, because students are names and not numbers!

*My Priorities:*
1: Empowering the Student Voice
2:  Create Synergy between the Faculty, Admin and Student
3: Institute an Academic Sessions Centre on campus  to help students with courses
4: Ensure quality study Content and peer tutoring 
5: Synergy between student and TAs.
6: Negotiable Deadlines for courses where students are struggling.

Thank you for your votes!!!

[13/11/2021, 12:52:12] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: Good Afternoon Tartans,
When I graduated high school and was beginning my university journey, I was told that university work will be different, that I'll be responsible for my own learning experience, and that I will shape my future with my hands. This was unfortunately not true. I found myself in a constant struggle to finish homework, read for tests and cram for exams. 
After a hectic first semester here at CMU, I fear the same fate will be upon all of us. I see my colleagues struggling to understand what tasks they are given, stressed over the miscommunication and under so much pressure that extracurricular activities are not just a dream.
When selected for office, I will:
Work with the students to make sure every single concern is heard.
Work with the director of academics and the new CMU administration to make sure actions are taken on these concerns.
Leverage the network of students, alumni, staff and instructors to create opportunities for us to expand our learning experience.
Work on creating a more collaborative environment between students and TAs
Make sure we are communicated to clearly and regularly.
Make sure we have a clear set of requirements and expected outcomes for each course. 
Work on leveraging the student-student relationships to create a collaborative environment where we all benefit from each other.

I specifically chose to run for this position because from being a student myself and from the many conversation I've had with many of you, I know a lot needs to be worked on and I chose to be part of the solution

Below are the points of focus deduced from the conversation I've had with many of you but my aim is to listen, be flexible, and inclusive so if you feel there's any issue not addressed or any wish you have please reach out and I'll make sure that it's also represented.

1. Course content and  delivery

2. Create an information bank for opportunities and the resources available to exploit them

3. Introduce creative ways to actually achieve deep approach to learning

4. Stand as critical link between students and administration to ensure expectations from both sides are met

5. Facilitate students in making informed decisions on courses and providing relevant resources to succeed in those courses 

My name is *Pierrette Mahoro Mastel*, a candidate for the Academics and research ministry.

[15/11/2021, 08:47:59] Adebayo EniOluwafe: *TL;DR:*
✅ Hooray! We are officially in the last leg of the semester relay race! Congratulations! Workload might increase exponentially in this phase but you got this!

✅ Spring schedule is here! *All Spring 2021 courses will be In-Person Expected (No Zoom)*. Please see the email with the subject 'Spring Course Schedule and Registration' for more information.

✅ There are more courses in the Spring. This means there will be more classes clashing so *make up your mind quickly* about which courses you want to take so that potential clashes can 
be resolved quickly (or you will realise on-time you cannot take those courses together).

✅ You will probably need these links - CMU Africa Courses Link, Courses Catalog, and Academic Calendar. 

✅ *The Academic Integrity Standard is very important. In case you have forgotten what that means, check here. When unsure; ask, do not assume!* Do not try to be smart, the Eagle is watching!

✅ You are required to treat everyone, even when you do not agree with them, with courtesy and respect as a Tartan. *Name-calling a TA, being verbally abusive or overly aggressive, among other things over any issue constitutes community standards infringement (see here).* Any grievances about processes, the Guild constitution, grading, workload, etc should go through the appropriate channels.

✅ Elections are here, please be actively involved! Ask the candidates pertinent questions. Don't be swayed by charisma, guile, nationality allegiance, looks, gender, and any other meaningless factor. Remember, it is not about the 'what I want to do', it is about how they plan to do it and how realistic those plans are!

Dear Tartan, 

I would have written a long email but I know that chances are high that you will not read it and I also have a deep learning assignment to complete ... So see you at the next update.

Kind regards,
Adebayo
[15/11/2021, 08:49:04] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Read your email for the links 🙃🙃🙃
[15/11/2021, 08:56:24] ‪+250 781 961 727‬: 1) The eagle is watching🤓

[15/11/2021, 09:06:34] Adebayo EniOluwafe: By the way, this is not a joke! I do not want the school to make scapegoats out of anyone to drive home the point but if that must happen for people to get it, I am with the school on that!
[15/11/2021, 09:08:27] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Sorry but not sorry but Class of 2023, please be really careful! There is substantial evidence on large-scale and widespread attempts to game the system and the only thing that hasn't happened so far is that nobody wants to use the evidence .. yet
[15/11/2021, 09:10:34] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I can name like 5 courses off the top of my head where we have had reported cases of some form of AIV on a class-wide basis. You do not need a Sherlock Holmes to solve these cases to be honest. If this continues, the school will definitely make an example of some people
[15/11/2021, 09:13:37] Adebayo EniOluwafe: For example, 50% of the class copying answers from a textbook's solution manual and then referencing it *does not* absolve of the AIV committed. There is such as a thing as *Unauthorized Assistance* and referencing that does not help your case.
[15/11/2021, 09:19:28] Esther Namara cmu: Noted.

[15/11/2021, 11:27:53] ‪+250 781 961 727‬: Some have begun their job, winning votes already🔥🔥😅
[15/11/2021, 11:28:35] ‪+250 781 961 727‬: AIV policy
[15/11/2021, 12:29:22] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: First thing on the agenda already ✌🏾
[15/11/2021, 12:30:50] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: share with us the agenda man 😒 let me find something to shake
[15/11/2021, 12:34:04] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: Alright so the Agenda includes working on clearing the AIV policies and working on having a clear set of rules that people can look at and see where they are, that includes some of the finer things that people have fallen into in the previous semesters
[15/11/2021, 12:35:10] ‪+254 719 801385‬: Hasn't this already been done. We took a long class on AIV during orientation. Policies are available online
[15/11/2021, 12:35:11] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: it also includes running a form to see what courses people are thinking about and then creating a document or other materials of experiences of previous people with them
[15/11/2021, 12:35:49] ‪+254 719 801385‬: And when in doubt, people can always ask the instructor
[15/11/2021, 12:36:13] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: Yeah but the people don't normally go to the online website and it's better to combine examples with the theoretical knowledge
[15/11/2021, 12:37:15] ‪+254 719 801385‬: The problem we have with AIV is not that people don't know the rules. Its that the teaching is so vague that its inpossible to know how to answer questions or do assignmentd.
[15/11/2021, 12:37:21] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: Also typically people fear accountability if they ask about something they have done, fearing that people will look into their work looking for violations that they were not paying attention to, so they just avoid raising suspicions about themselves
[15/11/2021, 12:38:22] ‪+254 719 801385‬: You are probably right. Just my two cents.
[15/11/2021, 12:38:40] Fen Rice Ofentse cmu: 💯
[15/11/2021, 12:38:53] Adebayo EniOluwafe: This is Grad School ...
[15/11/2021, 12:39:18] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I think a number of people do not know that there is a big big difference between Undergrad and Grad school
[15/11/2021, 12:40:00] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Student centered learning
[15/11/2021, 12:40:00] ‪+254 719 801385‬: Please explain
[15/11/2021, 12:40:01] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It iis not even high school to university kind of difference
[15/11/2021, 12:40:05] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: yeah man no worries, a conversation is always beneficial
[15/11/2021, 12:40:54] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It is even beyond this in a way
[15/11/2021, 12:41:03] Fen Rice Ofentse cmu: Totally Grad school bits me though why only one course is vague amongst all i have seen so far
[15/11/2021, 12:41:28] Fen Rice Ofentse cmu: No one wants to be spoon fed, clarity is important
[15/11/2021, 12:41:49] Adebayo EniOluwafe: So far...
[15/11/2021, 12:42:05] Esther Namara cmu: I don’t want to sound anyhow but I also think it’s kinda not right for us not to discuss maybe not to all write the same thing at the end of the day but discussion is important at this level given the kind of skill variety each of us possesses.

I actually thought I was in grad school to learn more from not only professors but also fellow students.
[15/11/2021, 12:42:26] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The easiest courses are always in the first fall semester
[15/11/2021, 12:42:52] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I do not believe there is one course at CMU that you are not allowed to discuss with your pairs
[15/11/2021, 12:42:55] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: I think when a large majority of people complain about clarity and communication that means that there is a problem that we need to discuss
[15/11/2021, 12:42:59] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Can you name one?
[15/11/2021, 12:43:00] Fen Rice Ofentse cmu: The point is not easy, the point is confusion. Easy is subjective
[15/11/2021, 12:43:01] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Just one
[15/11/2021, 12:43:09] Esther Namara cmu: Huh?😂
So many of them 🏃🏻‍♀️
[15/11/2021, 12:43:19] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Name one
[15/11/2021, 12:43:36] ‪+229 66 26 94 81‬: No matter how you do your registration?
[15/11/2021, 12:43:36] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Don't make them do this
[15/11/2021, 12:43:44] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: that's a really subjective view man
[15/11/2021, 12:43:44] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: Am I the only one who believes that the professor and TA work is correlated with AIV?
[15/11/2021, 12:43:55] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Sometimes a problem exist because people have expectations that *cannot* be met
[15/11/2021, 12:44:23] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I am waiting please
[15/11/2021, 12:44:33] Esther Namara cmu: I won’t of course 😂 but we have been told to seek for permission to discuss with fellow students
[15/11/2021, 12:44:44] Adebayo EniOluwafe: You do not just throw around points if you are not going to back them up with evidence
[15/11/2021, 12:44:47] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: also expectation of the course that is not me 😉
[15/11/2021, 12:45:08] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: met*
[15/11/2021, 12:45:41] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Now this is bullshit.
[15/11/2021, 12:45:58] Adebayo EniOluwafe: If you are ready to back things up with evidence, don't mention them
[15/11/2021, 12:46:03] Fen Rice Ofentse cmu: Course expectations should be the target
[15/11/2021, 12:46:20] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: we had experience where a course's expectations were very high and after complains, bad grades and the course taking more than the 12 hours even for the most familiar students with the material being taught, the instructor had to change, so there is some unreal expectations being put from the teachers also that we can't ignore
[15/11/2021, 12:46:24] Adebayo EniOluwafe: This definitely happends
[15/11/2021, 12:47:02] Adebayo EniOluwafe: But that is another subject matter entirely

[15/11/2021, 12:47:22] Adebayo EniOluwafe: This also happens
[15/11/2021, 12:47:29] Baby: A kind advice: if a course is said to be a 12 units, plan to spend around 18, to avoid surprises
[15/11/2021, 12:47:42] Adebayo EniOluwafe: More like 24
[15/11/2021, 12:47:56] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Or 18 hours outside class
[15/11/2021, 12:48:59] Adebayo EniOluwafe: In the end, right the 12 hours stuff is an ideal for a student that is perfectly suited for that course
[15/11/2021, 12:49:31] Adebayo EniOluwafe: You can always negotiate expectations with your instructors but don't think it is a right
[15/11/2021, 12:49:34] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: if a student have expectations of the course and then find TAs are not explaining things neither the professor, and they can't drop the course? Their option would be probably AIV (since without it they can will be also failing the course). I am not saying that AIV is a good option but let's say it's a shared problem. Some courses you cannot do even AIV because the professor knows how to do the things and how they can make the quiz or the exam. @2348109250377
[15/11/2021, 12:49:48] Adebayo EniOluwafe: *Not even the director of academics can tell a professor how to run his/her course*
[15/11/2021, 12:49:50] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: why is that? some courses that are much more demanding in material that the course I gave an example about had a very clear pathway to settling in, yes for the start it took like 24 units but if someone was able to cover the first couple of weeks it settled into the 12 units
‎[15/11/2021, 12:49:59] Esther Namara cmu: ‎sticker omitted
[15/11/2021, 12:50:33] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Any ideas you have that involves teaching professors how to pattern their courses wont work
[15/11/2021, 12:50:39] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Please don't feel entitled
[15/11/2021, 12:50:45] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It won't work
[15/11/2021, 12:50:51] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It is as simple as that
[15/11/2021, 12:51:16] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: entitled is a big word bro
[15/11/2021, 12:51:43] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: I guess the next academics minister should create also focus groups after getting the feedback (even though it's part of the work of the faculty)
[15/11/2021, 12:51:48] Adebayo EniOluwafe: A Professor has 99% liberty on the course structure. That is why a 15 units course like Cloud Computing can take 50 hours per week and nobody can do anything about ir
[15/11/2021, 12:52:13] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I will repeat this: *Not even the DIrector of Academics can do anything about it*
[15/11/2021, 12:52:19] ‪+23755934149‬: AIV is not an option at all.
[15/11/2021, 12:52:35] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: AIV is an escape
[15/11/2021, 12:52:54] Adebayo EniOluwafe: There are CMU courses that several departments across multiple campuses have complained about the workload for years and nothing has changed
[15/11/2021, 12:53:00] ‪+23755934149‬: ✅
[15/11/2021, 12:53:23] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: so if a 6 unit course has tow 2-hour lectures and a weekly homework I should just shut up and dribble?
[15/11/2021, 12:53:24] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: AIV reflects a problem in the system, it does not just reflect that the students are trying to copy
[15/11/2021, 12:53:35] Fen Rice Ofentse cmu: Next academic minister, i just need a sync, synergy between the instructors and TAs, it should be clear this is an academic team....if i can that only my problems will be solved.
[15/11/2021, 12:53:41] Adebayo EniOluwafe: You can negotiate. I do this all the time
[15/11/2021, 12:53:43] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: *Not even the director of academics can tell a professor how to run his/her course*
[15/11/2021, 12:53:45] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: haha
[15/11/2021, 12:54:30] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I do not approach the issue from an 'entitlement' mentality. I approach it from 'sir/ma, students are really struggling with this course, can we do try to do this or this?'
[15/11/2021, 12:55:12] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I have had several such meetings this semester when I am made aware of the problem. Sometimes, things improve. Most times, they don't.
[15/11/2021, 12:55:50] ‪+229 62 56 80 64‬: You are required to treat everyone, even when you do not agree with them, with courtesy and respect as a Tartan.

......
[15/11/2021, 12:56:10] Adebayo EniOluwafe: There was a course every student failed last semester because the professor was somehow
[15/11/2021, 12:56:31] ‪+23755934149‬: AIV is most of the time due to people not willing to get the grades that reflect their true level. The other cases are due to ignorance or incomprehension of the policy.
[15/11/2021, 12:56:35] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The school took actions after the semester on the Professor but every student still failed it
[15/11/2021, 12:57:02] Baby: 💀
[15/11/2021, 12:57:19] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Bullshit means nonsense. You can use the synonym if that is what you prefer.
[15/11/2021, 12:57:32] ‪+23755934149‬: Nice catch 🤣
[15/11/2021, 12:58:29] ‪+229 62 56 80 64‬: I don't think it's nice to tell someone what they are saying is nonsense though..
[15/11/2021, 12:58:30] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: Amazing just amazing 😉
[15/11/2021, 12:58:56] ‪+250 784 912 684‬: 😂😂
[15/11/2021, 12:58:59] Esther Namara cmu: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sis just don’t worry.
[15/11/2021, 12:59:21] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: @22962568064 shaking table live
[15/11/2021, 13:00:03] Esther Namara cmu: We see, we read, we move! 🏃🏻‍♀️
[15/11/2021, 13:00:30] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Apologies if it hurt your feelings but I say bullshit all the time and it is not an attack on the person but the point. But yeah, sorry if it is hurt your feelings.
[15/11/2021, 13:00:35] Fen Rice Ofentse cmu: 💯 but i have realized in CMU groups bad behavior is applauded you will never get anyway addressing it
[15/11/2021, 13:00:48] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: someone should change the position they're running for huh!
[15/11/2021, 13:01:19] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: now this is bullshit hahaha
[15/11/2021, 13:01:55] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Back to the point, *Students have no right to determine what the syllabus or deliverables for a course is*
[15/11/2021, 13:02:09] ‪+23755934149‬: Shaking a table that was regaining stability  🤣
[15/11/2021, 13:02:15] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: (bullshit in the sense of I hear you but I don't hear you) trying not to hurt any fealing
[15/11/2021, 13:02:15] Adebayo EniOluwafe: CMU offers the degree for you meeting *their criteria*.
[15/11/2021, 13:03:04] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: *Students have ever right to complain and push for change if the reality doesn't meet the advertised load*
[15/11/2021, 13:03:12] Adebayo EniOluwafe: This is something you should remember a thousand and one times!
[15/11/2021, 13:03:38] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Lol. There are 4 or 5 CMU campuses and the workload is the same almost everywhere
[15/11/2021, 13:03:41] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: *CMU has an obligation to be clear about the load and about the expected needs and requirements*
[15/11/2021, 13:04:06] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I am not denying the fact that I don't like the way the system is set up.
[15/11/2021, 13:04:18] Adebayo EniOluwafe: However, nobody is tying you down too
[15/11/2021, 13:05:16] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: no, I take half of my courses in Pittsburgh, the load is advertised clearly in all of those courses, assignments are clearer, grading expectations and schemes are well described, I know what am signing up to and there is no complains about clarity
[15/11/2021, 13:05:25] Adebayo EniOluwafe: *CMU is clear about that. That is the funny part*
[15/11/2021, 13:05:40] Esther Namara cmu: It’s sad if it’s being applauded by leaders themselves 👀😱
[15/11/2021, 13:05:49] Adebayo EniOluwafe: You cannot hold them to the 12 units - 12 hours thing because there is a subjective clause attached
[15/11/2021, 13:06:12] Baby: About the load, it depends on which course. Are you taking cloud or DL?
[15/11/2021, 13:06:22] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The student has to be *perfect* for the course. This means you have all the required experience and background
[15/11/2021, 13:06:27] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: guys I belive @2348109250377 is disappointed more than us but he just don't want to give false expectations hahaha Bro just try to give us from where we can start and how to push forward!
[15/11/2021, 13:06:35] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: I am taking NLP and Intro to ML
[15/11/2021, 13:06:42] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Really? please which courses .. lol
[15/11/2021, 13:06:56] Adebayo EniOluwafe: And you finish NLP and Intro to ML in 12 hours per week?
[15/11/2021, 13:07:12] Baby: I know there are Pittsburgh courses that take 35+ hours😂
[15/11/2021, 13:07:34] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: yea, after the first homework, I spend 12 hours every week on it, I spend less time on it thatn ASP
[15/11/2021, 13:08:27] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Good. Have you considered you are the exception not the norm? And this is only so because you are *perfect* for the course?
[15/11/2021, 13:08:28] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: these are similar courses, math, 12 units, ml focused
[15/11/2021, 13:08:52] Adebayo EniOluwafe: There is a whole problem with prerequisites that cannot be equalized across students
[15/11/2021, 13:09:04] Catherine Wanjiru cmu: Then there is us struggling in the same course😭
[15/11/2021, 13:09:15] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Exactly!
[15/11/2021, 13:09:35] Adebayo EniOluwafe: This is like saying deep learning is not hard because I finish assignments way before deadline
[15/11/2021, 13:10:02] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Like, please. I prepared the whole summer specially to take deep learning
[15/11/2021, 13:10:10] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: no man, I scored the minimum score in the first intro to ML homework man 😂😂😂. The instructor was clear that the first HW will gauge your math, if you score badly in it then you need to work on these items and then you'll be better, and that is exactly what happened
[15/11/2021, 13:10:25] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I am probably far advanced in my prerequisite knowledge compared to a lot of people
[15/11/2021, 13:11:26] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The point still remains - courses are set up in such a way that you can finish in 12 hours if you know *exactly* what to do based on your prior experience and all
[15/11/2021, 13:12:20] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The problem though is that you will never know *exactly* what to do  and the spectrum on that gap depends on which student for which course. The 12 hours stuff does not account for that.
[15/11/2021, 13:12:55] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Where you will have a point is if even TAs cannot finish the task with 12 hours given that they know exactly what to do
[15/11/2021, 13:15:35] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Like I said, you can always negotiate as a class to ensure that as many students as possible are close to the 'advertised timeframe' but don't think the instructor is a horrible person if he/she does not change the schedule to suit the class strength. They are not.
[15/11/2021, 13:16:11] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: still not from 12 to 24 (this is a huge difference I guess)
[15/11/2021, 13:16:43] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: 💯💯✅
[15/11/2021, 13:16:56] ‪+249 91 841 8533‬: All I wanted to get through is that the system is not perfect, and there is some success in trying to fix where you can, calling people *entitled* for trying to fix the system is not very good I think, and there is some confusion that when experienced by the majority of the people, means we need to address it
[15/11/2021, 13:17:08] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I probably use 30 hours on deep learning per week and I don't think I am struggling
[15/11/2021, 13:17:51] ‪+216 53 279 160‬: this the f*cking problem
[15/11/2021, 13:18:10] Tiano: DSA students, please check the announcement on Piazza or Canvas.
[15/11/2021, 13:18:11] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Even for courses like Intro to Info Sec that was super cheap, I spent 12 hours outside clas
[15/11/2021, 13:18:24] Adebayo EniOluwafe: For me not the instructor.
[15/11/2021, 13:18:50] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I am the one who doesn't understand the PyTorch and Numpy libraries well enough to use them efficiently
[15/11/2021, 13:19:04] Adebayo EniOluwafe: That is on me, not the instructor
[15/11/2021, 13:19:33] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I am the one whose calculus and algebra can be sometimes fuzzy. That is on me, not the instructor
[15/11/2021, 13:20:00] Adebayo EniOluwafe: If I had to redo all the assignments, I will finish them within the advertised timesteps easily

[15/11/2021, 13:22:38] Adebayo EniOluwafe: So in the end, it wasn't that the assignment was tough, it was that I didn't know Java enough and had to struggle a lot

We are here for 2 years or less in a system that has seen coutless students passing through it. The smarter thing would be to work hard and ask nicely rather than make demands like we have the right to change something that has been demonstrated to be effective. 
Actually, even when we ask we need to make sure we don't come off the wrong way. Cause we are in its hands not the other way around.

But calling a whole batch "entitled" for asking for clarity is not right at all, we have every right to ask for changes in what effects us negatively. We are all grownups and saying that this isn't undergrad makes us seem like little children who don't know what the real world is about. If something isn't changeable no one will complain, but the things that need a bit more pushing need to be pushed, the faculty is really responsive and do listen to student's concerns, so I'd expect the same from the guild who should be our voice with them. And I really believe @2348109250377 and the team are doing what they can, I really do and this is not an attack or anything, but "entitled", "this is not undergrad" and the sentiment that we should just be happy that we got here doesn't sit right with me.

[16/11/2021, 01:57:19] Moise Sangwa cmu: *My view on what has been happening in all this conversation*, is to call my fellow tartans to put much energy into their work and work to excel. In the past years, the student's number was low, so think about what will happen if the student's number has increased, and they want to keep their standards... of course, they will be tougher than before. In regards of changing some of the course structure or content... As @2348109250377 said, nothing much they will change... because they are teaching us, hey already have a system that has been established for years. If you doubt check this link if you did Pfun: *http://public.africa.cmu.edu/cbishop/orientation2017/index.html* I got it from online, This is Cathy Bishop in 2017, and last year we used the same module, and, she said that she does updates each year if there is a new release in the language. So think twice then, if the same module has been taught since 2012 and students were scoring *As* in it, no AIV, etc... do you really think they will change much? There is also another Professor in Energy systems who give us some pre-recorded video from 2016, which shows that they already have a curriculum set. And I think it is explicit why *AIV* for them is crucial, coz there graduated people there who can you answers for almost the whole degree, same as in *DIAML*, etc. Maybe adjustments will be made in these newly introduced courses, but I recommend that before also complaining about the course, review a bit on its history... For the Pfun, the case might be different this year because I heard that the instructor him/herself does not understand the module (Not sure though, this is what crossed my ears). So, if its the case, then students have room to complain about the instructor, not the course. Concerning the TAs, remember that they are also students and they don't have finals answers to all the student's questions, because s/he might be also falling in the AIV issues, But the instructor can, if not, the school can... *Just my opinion*

The school has promised that for those who come clean, the punishment will be only a reprimand and another class on Academic Integrity. Specifically, if you were by any chance involved in the mass cheating that involved screenshots and the midterms of DIAML, the investigations are being concluded. Please come clean! If you cannot approach Martin or Olga yourself, please talk to me. By the way, this is not only restricted to DIAML, large-scale cross-course investigations are taking place and believe me, there is no escaping!*
[16/11/2021, 09:06:00] Adebayo EniOluwafe: By the way, knowing about incidents of AIV and not reporting them is also considered an AIV. So, whether or not you were directly involved, knowledge and not reporting makes you complicit so just come forward if you know anything. For DIAML, I got new information yesterday that the investigations are being rounded up because some of the primary instigators came clean already.

[16/11/2021, 13:53:54] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The schedule is pretty tight so if a lot of students do not complain about a pair, it would not be considered. So this is important
[16/11/2021, 13:54:49] yussuf Paapy cmu: I 👀, and again what is the alternative for Strategic Use and is it going to be offered this sem? Please #NoVayolence

[16/11/2021, 13:56:33] Adebayo EniOluwafe: According to reports, Prof Bezy is taking only 35 students so you need you make up your minds fast.

Thank you.

[19/11/2021, 00:27:46] Moise Sangwa cmu: *What question would you ask a candidate running for a ministerial position in the Students Guild? (Survey)*

Dear tartans,
As the presidential debate is approaching, the EC would like to give a chance to students to send a question that will be asked candidates running for ministerial positions. For the residential position, questions will be asked directly in person or remotely after hearing from their manifestos.

Kindly make it short and send one question per position. The most repeated question will be the one to be responded by all the candidates after their manifesto presentations.

The link here: https://forms.gle/ePHvG6pyG55sByZu6 will be open until tomorrow the 19th Nov at 9 AM.

Regards

Moise Sangwa Mukunzi

[23/11/2021, 14:55:05] ‪+1 (437) 234‑3277‬: FYI, when you are looking for reviews for courses you want to take, if it is a remote course (Pittsburgh/SV to Kigali), remember to ask how remote friendly the course is. Some professors don’t exactly give two shits about a good or great remote experience and would not prioritize remote students in their classes.

[23/11/2021, 14:57:13] Adebayo EniOluwafe: There will be two NLP courses in the Spring, which one are you referring to

[23/11/2021, 15:02:05] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I did the course ;last Spring and it was ok but that was when everyone was on Zoom. The reviews this semester were not so good regarding the remote learning experience. The Director of Academics even emailed the instructors on that and as at the last time we spoke about this, they did not respond to him. So, keep that in mind.
[23/11/2021, 15:03:05] Adebayo EniOluwafe: That is why we pushed that the Kigali NLP course be available to people who are interested in NLP regardless.
[23/11/2021, 15:03:25] Pacifique Iradukunda cmu: I’m taking that, but it’s not remote friendly 😏

[26/11/2021, 09:31:44] Tiano: Moise, and EC, what happens to candidates who are elected and unfortunately, later found guilty of AIV? What happens to their positions? I asked earlier but I was ignored.
I know there's lots of investigation about AIV going on.
[26/11/2021, 09:34:51] Adebayo EniOluwafe: ✅✅✅
[26/11/2021, 10:10:34] Moise Sangwa cmu: Hello, @256784286046 I have not really ignored your message, I remember planning to get back to you but it passed on me. You should have reminded me at least! Here is what I think: The constitution does not say anything about the AIV but it suggests that a student must be of exemplary conduct and high repute in the students’ body. In the nominations, we looked into that and there was so such issues so far. Therefore, if anyhow after being elected someone's found guilty, it will all depend on the decision the school will take. If someone is dismissed, the position will fall *Vacant* and there is a way the constitution handles vacant positions and even a way to do special elections. Other than,  it could be personal unless that person is is found guilty by the appropriate tribunal of violation of the Leadership Code of Conduct.
[26/11/2021, 10:14:47] Tiano: 👍🏽👍🏽, I see. Thanks.
[26/11/2021, 10:18:22] Moise Sangwa cmu: ....no such issues so far...
[26/11/2021, 10:18:24] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Just to be clear @250783430950 , the electoral committee did check with student services to confirm that every candidate does not have any pending AIV issue, am I correct?

[26/11/2021, 10:22:22] Moise Sangwa cmu: I am nure what you mean by here... who do you mean by the Students services?
[26/11/2021, 10:26:43] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Did you check with Olga that every candidate was clear to contest given their current AIV records? Someone may not have been officially convicted yet because the committee has not determined the appropriate punishment yet or because they have not had time to meet. Also, even when students are convicted, it would not be announced formally (only the affected students are communicated with). Only Student Services (mostly Olga in this case) have the complete record as it relates to the academics of every student.
[26/11/2021, 10:35:19] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Just to clear, I don't have any concrete information on any candidate's academic records (way above my pay grade) so you might be right that all the candidates are clear. I am just asking to be sure everything is in place since @256784286046 raise this very important issue.

[26/11/2021, 11:29:41] Moise Sangwa cmu: @CMU Adebayo, maybe you have information on people concerned with AIV issues or ongoing investigations, which I think it is something confidential. Me also as an Auditor, I might be under those investigations. So, the constitution does not say anything about the AIV, and those are confidential information for the administration, they couldn't share that with us and as you said "only the affected students are communicated". We worked hand in hand with the student's services affairs and they didn't pose questions on candidates. Candidates are encouraged to raise with the commission if they have related issues.

[29/11/2021, 17:23:40] Courage Ekoh CMU: Hello Tartans,

As you know, Giving Tuesday is upon us. Through the IFFF, CMU has been able to sponsor a number of students over the year, where they are able to access quality education that positions them in a way to help shape their community and their future as well. You, reading this email, may be one of such students.

Your generous donation helps CMU to continue this good work of offering the brightest young minds in Africa to expand the frontiers of learning and impact Africa positively. Over the years, we have had this legacy at CMU-Africa where during Giving Tuesday, we record almost 100% participation, or even 100%.

Remember, generosity is not the state of your pocket, but of the heart. And as tartans, if indeed, your heart is in the work, then deep your hands into your pocket, and support the work.

The following channels can be used for your donation:
Bank deposit

As we are nearing the end of the semester (yeah at last😁), I hope you are as exited as me for the handover to our new Club and Guild leaders (Yeah we got rid of our lovely second-year dinosaurs😙, thanks for what you have done so far🤗) who have *a lot of work to get done* ("*Beaucoup de pain sur la planche*" is the corresponding French expression). And the French club is not at rest because we are preparing a lot of new and fun activities (don't worry, Valentine's day activity will not be removed😌) for you both virtual and in-person (on Campus or anywhere in Kigali). To bring you all this fun that will help you evade from CMU assignments (sorry to say the A-word haha) we need a bit of preparation and we will come back in the Spring semester! (Sorry for the inconvenience).
****ALERT SPOILER******
Those activities will include (but not limited) poetry, karaoke, how to flirt in French (It is the language of romance after all) etc etc... Do not hesitate to suggest activities you would like to have through this link https://forms.gle/9avUtEXdARZP4Jv48.
**** END SPOILER****

Thanks for having attended previous meetings and we are waiting for you for the upcoming ones. 

Bonus: "I like your smile." translated in French gives "J'aime ton sourire." (come to meetings to learn the pronounciation😉)

Chiron Bang, President of the French Club.
[01/12/2021, 20:17:17] G William Kasaazi cmu: Thanks but did I just miss the "TL;DR;" somehow

[02/12/2021, 07:55:17] Ayobami CMU Esther: Mwaramutse Tartans,

As JF Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, once said, “We must find time to stop and thank the people who make a difference in our lives.”

It has indeed been a great pleasure to serve you these past 10 months. It has been a fantastic ride promoting diversity and inclusion with the many activities held on campus (zoom!) and learning about the different countries represented on campus. What has made the journey even more remarkable is your unwavering support and commitment to making the community vibrant and active during the numerous programs organized by the International Student Affairs Ministry.

Similarly, let us remember the famous maxim that says, “change begins with you.” Over the past 10 months, we have observed several fundamental issues in our respective countries, and we should resolve to make and be the change we want to see in our continent. Be the leading light and the trailblazer of everything good.

To the Rwandans, murakoze for being such wonderful hosts. To the international students, it has been one of the most trying times being in another country while so many distractions happen in our home countries. As always, we stand together!

To my incredible team, Israel Oladejo, Fonyuy Lami Boris, Michael Sambou, Favour Aderinto, and Richard Kagame, you have been the excellent support and the best team anyone can have. Even though I was the lead, you made everything work. You all were the drummers that stayed in the shadows while everyone heard the music and danced. Thank you for all the sacrifices and your heart of service.

To the country representatives, we appreciate you.

To the honorable outgoing guild members, you have all been simply amazing and a beautiful team. The synergy made everything easy, thank you.

To the Student Services/Student Affairs, Ines Manzi, Mika Inamahoro, Olga Gikundiro Buki, and other members, we appreciate your prompt actions and always being proactive and giving us all the needed support at all times. You are just the best.

Lastly, thank you, staff, and faculty for putting up with all our emails and standing with us while sharing in each of our joy and pains, and for all the words of encouragement; God bless you.

Thank you to the student body for the incredible memories at the Wakanda and Superheroes-themed parties and the codename wars (Tartans Cave). We hope they served as a much-deserved break from school.

Lastly, we wish success to the incoming administration. We hope you keep the CMU bond and make it a family where everyone finds a sense of belonging.

Cheers! Thank you.

[09/12/2021, 10:20:15] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Hello Tartans,

Today, the 30th of December 2021, we join with our fellow Tartans from the lush highlands and great lakes of Tanzania as they celebrate their 60th Independence Day. Tanzania became a sovereign state in 1964 after the merger of the previously independent states of Tanganyika and Zanzibar. From the 1880s to 1919, when it became a British mandate under the League of Nations, the region was a colony and part of German East Africa.

Tanzania is recognized as a fantastic safari location, owing to its numerous world-class wildlife viewing chances. Tanzania is home to many of Africa's best and largest parks, as well as some of the world's most diverse and unusual landscapes. Tanzania, with its grasslands, woods, rock formations, and mountain peaks, offers unquestionably amazing prospects for tourism and photography.

As a closely knit community which share a lot in common, let us endeavor to felicitate and celebrate with our Tanzanian community as they celebrate a remarkable 60th year of independence, and if you cannot do it for anything, do it for Mount Kilimanjaro.


Happy Independence Day.

The Tartans Community Celebrates You.

Hongera sana watanzania🥂

Thank you.
Best regards,

[11/12/2021, 00:46:48] ‪+23755934149‬: Interesting video even though it's more of a "riot" video than something objective.
One point really important is that the 50% staying in France are used to ensure the parity of the CFA that maintains the convertibility 665 = 1 Euro (approximately). And sorry to tell you that but it definitely helps because I don't think those country will be able to sustain their own money simply because their economy is weak (at least for my country that's the case). I'm not for the CFA but the fact is that the root of the problem is the economy. Once the economy has attain a good level, the money will become the problem. 
Yelling everywhere that Francophone countries continue to pay "taxes" won't help. Making the economy grow will! 
And lastly, it's totally normal that powerful (well not so powerful because we are talking about France) countries make use of their power over weak countries. Weak countries should try to grow, not complain everywhere as if another country is going to help them.

Ooh wait a damn minute, there actually is someone who is benefiting from it... *The MF French*
You see my brother, one way the French ensures these countries will never be rich enough to emancipate themselves from France is that CFA currency thingie. 
If you keep giving a man fish and never teach him how to fish, then you got yourself a slave that will always be coming back to for the food. 

You can be as positive as you would like to but this remains to be the truth that.... *COLONISATION, JUST LIKE ITS TWIN BROTHER SLAVERY, WAS AND IS WRONG, THERE IS NO SILVER-LINING TO IT, THERE IS NO ... "THE WHITE MAN IS HELPING THESE ECONOMIES REMAIN AFLOAT BY HAVING THEM DO THE 50% DEPOSIT" ... THERE IS NO ... "THE WHITE MAN BROUGHT LITERACY AND RELIGION" .. THERE SIMPLY AIN'T NOTHING* 

With all due respect... Fuck the French, British, Belgium, Portuguese and all them colonisers 😊😊😊
[11/12/2021, 10:19:14] ‪+23755934149‬: Let’s address each point you have mentioned here. *But the first thing is not to be emotional when you think about what is happening*. Yes, you are right it’s suspicious. And I like the fact you wrote “independence” (in quotes) because those independences were planned by colonizing countries and well planned. They thought of diverse techniques to keep their former colonies under control and that 50% thing is one of the ways as you have mentioned. But that’s not the only thing. There is another thing called “Free-exchange agreements” which exists between the European Union (EU) and some African countries and basically it consists of reducing taxes on exportations from EU to those African countries. What do you think will happen? (I let you think about it). 
And yeah, France and other Europeans countries are benefiting from Africans countries’ poverty but think more about it, they are not the only one benefiting…
And yes again, you are right, colonization and slavery are wrong (but don’t forget some of our chiefs in Africa participated by selling their own people too). But see things the other way too, you are also benefiting from the technologies and all good stuff colonization have brought. I’m not saying we wouldn’t have been able to live without (actually, we were well-off even before all that), but the trust is the truth, colonization brought good things too. And as we are telling the truth, those 50% helps too but I’m not saying it only has (or mostly has) advantages. Actually, it helps (in my opinion) because those countries’ economy is fragile (because of them but because of us too). And when you say F*ck them, don’t forget to mention other countries because China is not nice as well and let’s keep telling the truth that’s perfectly normal. *There’s nothing as friendship between countries but interests. It means that, if the poverty of your country ensures the well being of mine, why wouldn’t I keep you in that poverty if it helps in the long run?*
[11/12/2021, 10:27:12] Kelvin Kamande cmu: Am glad you have an open mind to see things from both perspectives. That means you are able to question your own views and see their pros and cons. However, one thing I believe is important is to keep the conversations going on the evils of colonisation. Be it from the white man or the Asian man or whoever it is. The sovereignty of every country must be respected and that only comes with first calling out the bullshit of these so called "Super-Power" countries. Finally, I do not consider myself emotional about African issues but I am definitely passionate about African realising that we have and keep being exploited by both the west and the east. Who knows, maybe if we keep the conversations going for long enough, it shall reach a generation that will actually do something about! Cause that generation is sure as the heavens ain't us

And I agree with the other things you said but colonization in the sense that it's no longer colonization but it's just countries relationships. And yeah sovereignty must be respected but if you don't weight enough in the balance powerful countries will simply abuse you (and other countries will take their part of the cake too if possible), that's awful but that's life. To get away from that, let's just work hard (and in silence) like China did and other countries too. #My thought though.

My point is that the money is not the most important problem, the economy is. You know what happens when a country is not able to make enough exportation and mostly do importation right?

And just to wrap up with an interesting fact, Smarthphones that we are all fond of are produced using cobalt (not only but it's involved in the process) extracted by companies in Democratic republic of Congo and of course they don't really benefit of that. But are we going to stop buying smartphones to support them? Haha I don't think so...

Man, in world politics, no one cares about you. It's all about vested interest. The French doesn't care about the economy in francophone countries... It's simply vested interest - what they stand to benefit

And if you think those economies won't stand without France backing, let them brake free first and let's see. They have made the damn countries to believe that they can't stand without the French

[12/12/2021, 16:37:03] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Hello Tartans,

 

Today, the 12th of December 2021, we join with our fellow Tartans from the Safari land of Kenya to celebrate Kenya’s 58th Independence(Jamhuri) Day. Jamhuri day, which commemorates not one, but two historic events. The first honors Kenya's proclamation of independence on 1st June 1963, while the second honors the East African nation's official creation as a Jamhuri (Swahili for "republic") one year later.

 

Kenya's landscape rises from the Indian Ocean's low coastal plain to mountains and plateaus in the interior. The majority of Kenyans reside in the highlands, where Nairobi, the capital, is about 5,500 feet above sea level (1,700 meters).

More than 60 languages are spoken in Kenya, and the country is home to more than 40 ethnic groups (which includes Kikuyu, Luo, Luhya, Kamba and Kalenjin). Almost everyone speaks multiple African languages there.

 

The savanna of Kenya has been featured in films, television shows, literature, and ads. It's the image that many people have of Africa when they think about the continent. Every year, millions of visitors travel to Kenya to experience the boundless savanna and the animals that live there, including elephants, lions, cheetahs, giraffes, zebras, hippos, rhinos, and more.

 

Let’s join with our amiable Kenyans as they celebrate Independence day.

 

Hongera Kenya! Happy Independence Day!🍾🍷


Best regards,
International Student Affairs Ministry (The Student Guild)

For anyone looking to take *Intro to Deep Learning* in Spring, I have got a few suggestions/helps to give you a somewhat good head start:

1. You may use this doc listing prerequisites to get your foundations solid before diving into the course in Spring.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z-06dJctxrhwl9QUje1NH_yKxHeKDJwc2PEiR6omfUY/edit

2. I would strongly recommend you do this course if you don't do anything else. It saved me in deep learning class from the Maths that almost killed me in MLSP class.🙄

https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning/
Entire Specialization: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning

3. If you feel strong enough with your Maths and Statistics knowledge, you may start taking a look at the first course in Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.
https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome
Entire Specialization: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning


Whilst taking a look at these, if you need help understanding anything, please reach out. If I have a decent enough number of people, I am happy to have one-off small sessions with these groups depending on our schedules.



On finally note, the deep learning course is not as bad as people paint it. You get a lot of value from it, whether or not you get the best grade.

Quick follow to the questions raised in regards to Deep Learning no longer being listed as ECE course,

1. To  those who wanted to register for Deep Learning but were confused which one to register for, you can choose 11-785. 

2.  As for the question if it will still count as one the ML concentration course,yes it will!

Apologies for the delay, it takes some time reaching people this time of the year

Holandia yogurt Is Expensive, But It Does Not Quench Thirst, Like Ordinary Water.

O'level(WASC/SSCE) is just an Ordinary certificate but without it you can't obtain a degree, Master's and PhD.

That Thing Called ‘Ordinary’ Does Not Mean It Is Not Valuable.
Water Might Be ‘Ordinary’, But Without It, There Is No Life.

Value Ordinary People! They Can Save Your Life.

Don’t Be Too Proud To Respond When Your Gateman Greets You.

Don't Be Too Proud To Adjust When That Junior Staff Calls Your Attention To Issues.

Don't Be Too Proud To Listen To The Advice Of Your Follower Because Some Of Them Are Even Better Leaders But You Are Only Privileged.

Don't Be Too Proud To Listen To Your Subordinates As A Leader Because You Don't Know It All.

Remember, it was an "ordinary" man that presented Solomon with the bed of Queen Sheba before he could blink his eyes. 

If You Treat The Ordinary People In Your Life Like Garbage, You May Die With Your Ailments.

Low-Class People Are Not Necessarily Low Life People.

Who Says You Are Better Than That Ordinary People?
Those Ordinary People Were Made By God And God Has Deposited In Them Strength And Weakness.

Don't Allow Your Pride To Destroy You, Call That Ordinary People, He or She Is Ready To Help You.

Wisdom Is Profitable To Direct And When We Do Things Together, We Do It Better.

*LET IT SINK INTO OUR MIND THAT ANYTHING CALLED ORDINARY HAS ITS VALUE*

A WORD IS ENOUGH FOR THE WISE.

*Mother*:  Thank you my daughter, but what about the one you put under the pillow on the bed?

*Daughter*:  I want to give that to my father.

*Mother*: How much is that?

*Daughter:*  #10,000.00k mummy.

*Mother*: Haa, is that not too much for your father. Do you think he needs money,  #5,000.00 is okay for him.

*Daughter:*  Mummy are you sure #5,00.00k is okay for him?

*Mother* : Yes. After all he just collected his #20,000.00 pension allowance on Friday.

*Daughter*  Thank you for the advice mummy (She then removed #5,000.00k from the money and put it back into her bag.) Carry the envelope and she get out of her mother's room and went to meet her father in the sitting room.

*Daughter*:  Daddy, I am going back to Lagos. Please, take this token from me Sir.

*Father*:  How much is that? The father asked without collecting the money from her. 

*Daughter* : #5,000.00k Daddy. She replied.

*Father*: Thank you my daughter, please, go and add it to the money you gave to your mother. (Though the father was not aware of the amount she gave to her mother) Don't you know that I was about to enter the room when your mother was advising you that #10,000.00k is too much for me. 

So #10,000.00k is too much for me now but it was not too much for me when I was single handedly responsible for your school fees from your elementary school to your second degree and paying your hostel fees in the secondary school and your pocket money throughout your university education.

Please, I don't need money as she rightly said.

*Daughter*: Crying, and went back to meet her mother in the room. Mummy, you see what you have caused now, after I have given you #20,000.00k, you said #10,000.00k is too much for my father.

*MOTHERS, ALLOW AND ADVISE YOUR CHILDREN TO CARE AND LOVE THEIR FATHERS TOO.*

Most especially those fathers that denied themselves the comforts of life to ensure their children did not lack and are properly cared for. "The fear of God is the begining of Wisdom."

*Happy Penultimate Thursday to Resumption* please stay safe.

To stay in Africa or not to stay?? 🙃

That's the million dollar question right? A CMU diploma on one hand and the world as your oyster on the other..

So why should we stay? Is there any good here, other than of course, the special mines in DRC, the oil in Nigeria, and the beauty that is Ethiopia, to name but a few.

See, such a fine line! urgh! 😖

Come let's talk about it..

This Friday, the 14th of January, between 7pm and 9pm..

Please also nominate your moderator and panelists using the link below? 

Can't wait to see you there!! 

One thing's for sure, this #kenyanBabe would love to see Africa win.

We are never favorites but the most successful team in Africa if you combine success on the African soil and in world football. Cameroon most recently won another Afcon before nigeria, senegal and egypt, Cameroon won Afcon on nigerian soil ( surulere 2000). Never write us off

We produce when least expected and always represent. The pressure of playing at home is huge but we will push them  to the latter stages. Cameroon vs Burkina Faso remains the most interesting game so far(twists, turns, var etc)

[22/01/2022, 21:20:42] ‪+254 715 633225‬: You're probably wondering what we have in store for you. 
Yes, we are here, and we bring excellent news. 
In collaboration with Cafeteria, we are now offering subscription services; you can pay for a half month or a month for a lunch buffet at the Cafeteria. 
The monthly subscription cost is 30k, and you receive two extra meals, how exciting is that? 
What if you don't come to school every day for the rest of the month? Worry not, you're covered on this, this means that if the month you subscribed in finishes but you still have some days left on your membership, you'll get 15 days in the following month to spend it. 

Thank you very much!

[24/01/2022, 08:04:14] Olivier Cmu 🇷🇼: *Who's running the World?*
Biden, Putin and Xi were arguing on who’s in charge of the world. 
. US, Russia or China? 
. Without any conclusion, they turned to Modi (India President) and asked him "Who’s in charge of the world?" 
Modi replied: All I know is:
1. Google CEO is an Indian 
2. Microsoft CEO is an Indian 
3. Citigroup CEO was an Indian 
4. SoftBank Vision Fund CEO is an Indian 
5. Adobe CEO is an Indian 
6. NetApp CEO is an Indian 
7. PepsiCo CEO was an Indian 
8. Nokia CEO is an Indian 
9. MasterCard CEO is an Indian 
10. DBS CEO is an Indian 
11. Cognizant CEO was an Indian 
12. Novartis CEO is an Indian 
13. Conduent CEO was an Indian 
14. Diageo CEO is an Indian 
15. SanDisk CEO was an Indian 
16. Motorola CEO was an Indian 
17. Harman CEO is an Indian 
18. Micron CEO is an Indian 
19. Palo Alto Networks CEO is an Indian 
20. Reckitt Benckiser CEO is an Indian 
21. Now IBM CEO is also an Indian origin guy 
22. Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer is an Indian 
23. Britain’s Home Secretary is an Indian 
24. Ireland’s Prime minister is an Indian. 
. So who's running the World? Very interesting! 
. That is the result of India policy since the early fifties to focus on education.
. Dr Abraham's Comment: 
 *Interesting...to know that they were just as abused as Blacks, yet they have quietly gone on to make an impact in the world!* 

*And the CEO of Dangote is Indian!*
*There is no alternative to quality* *education* *You are sought after!*
 _The price of greatness is responsibility_ . Sir Winston Churchill.

We had little 1 on 1 coffee chats, group meetings and many other interesting activities. On that note, I hope you don't miss out on this opportunity this time. Apply to CMU, and be best friends with the brightest from all over the world. Apply now, only took me 5mins may take you less.

*Few hours to go*
[29/01/2022, 19:45:18] Seth Abayo cmu: Yes, I recall @250788274411 , and it is still a top priority! However, because we have switched to an in-person class [this semester], and as previously communicated,  the internet money this time around will not be available😭. To those who have remote classes can still use the campus until 9:30 pm as this is the last bus drop off! Weekend transportation will be provided beginning next weekend, allowing you to have access to the campus at any time. Thanks

It will be of interest to know that in our last presentation in first year seminar, Lucy-Anna recommended toastmaster as a place for students to build their speaking skills. Why shy away from platform where no one flogs or laugh at you for making mistake but all willing, able, and ready to support you to develop yourself in leadership and public speaking. 
Don't leave CMU to regret the opportunity you never took or maximize. 
Have a blissful week beloved.

[01/02/2022, 09:51:29] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Hello Tartans,

Today February 1, 2022, our amiable host, Rwanda, commemorate Heroes Day, an annual ceremony honoring those who have exhibited and defended the highest principles of patriotism and sacrifice for the country's and citizens' well-being. The National Heroes’ Day also celebrates heroic values such as integrity, bravery, honesty, love, exemplary lifestyle and many more.
Heroes are celebrated in three different categories, Imanzi, Imena and Ingezi. The Imanzi is the supreme Hero who has exhibited extraordinary achievements marked by supreme sacrifice, great significance, and leadership. The Imena category comprises of heroes known for their extraordinary acts for the country marked by sacrifice, high importance, and example. Heroes who are still living but are known for their good ideas or spectacular achievements marked by sacrifice, enormous importance, and high example fall into the Ingenzi category.
We must not forget to mention a few of these heroes such as Gen. Fred Rwigema (Imanzi), who died on the frontline the day after the launch of the country’s armed liberation struggle in October 1990. For Imena category: King Mutara III Rudahigwa Charles Léon Pierre, Michel Rwagasana (special adviser to late King Rudahigwa), and Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who paid the ultimate price during the genocide. Ingezi heroes are living heroes but are not public yet.
Beyond the hassles of school and work, as we holiday to respect the selfless sacrifices of our National heroes, both living and departed, let us reflect on our ways, maybe someday, we too will be worthy heroes.
Umunsi mwiza w'intwari – Happy Heroes Day!  🎉🎊

[06/02/2022, 08:32:40] Esther Namara cmu: Good evening Tartans, one of us is stranded with tuition and the school mandates that the amount is reduced from $1700 to a figure below $1000 by April in order to register for the final semester. My humble appeal to us as a community is to lend a hand to our own by giving any amount that you can afford. 

We appreciate you for your generosity and pray that blessings follow you all the days of your life🙏🏾
Thank you all.

My humble appeal to us as a community is to lend a hand to our own by giving any amount that you can afford. 

We appreciate you for your generosity and pray that blessings follow you all the days of your life🙏🏾
Thank you all.

My humble appeal to us as a community is to lend a hand to our own by giving any amount that you can afford. 

We appreciate you for your generosity and pray that blessings follow you all the days of your life🙏🏾
Thank you all.

[09/02/2022, 12:19:57] Ayobami CMU Esther: *Important Announcement for Data Analytics Students: Requirements for an acceptable complete assignment submission*

*Any submission that is deemed incomplete will not be graded.*

The submission must include full evidence that the assignment was completed by the student and demonstrate a full understanding of each step in the process including textual descriptions of each result (statistics, table, graph etc) represents and insights that can be gained. In addition, each line of code should be documented by text. This demonstrates that the code is unique and owned by the student. Specific reasons for a submission being classified as incomplete include: 

    Failure to correctly name your folder, report, and code file with your andrewID-DA-AssignmentNo. For example, mcsharry-DA-Assignment1, mcsharry-DA-Assignment2 and mcsharry-DA-Assignment3.
    A missing report describing the steps, results, and insights 
    A missing dataset required for running the code 
    A missing code file such as .ipynb or .m file 
    An error in the file path needed to run the code 

The student is responsible for checking that their submission is complete. Students will lose 10% as for usual late submission even if the submission is repaired during the 24 hours after the deadline has passed.

Thank you.

Best wishes,

The TAs

    Plots without title, legend, x-axis, and y-axis label where relevant attracts a 20% deduction of the mark allotted to that part of the question
    Vague explanations where text answers are expected, attract a 20% deduction of the mark allotted to that part of the question.

20% of a question that carries 10marks is 2 marks
[09/02/2022, 12:30:27] Baby: I think it's 20 percent on that question only. So that will be like 2 overall
[09/02/2022, 12:30:36] Ayobami CMU Esther: 20% of the mark allocated to that part of the question. So if it is 5 marks for that part of the question 20% of the mark. That's -1
[09/02/2022, 12:31:20] Emmanuella Ametsi cmu: And some people complained that assignment marks were deducted without detailed explanation.


At least now, if you see a -2 on a question, you probably can tell where it’s coming from

[09/02/2022, 20:40:32] Esther Namara cmu: Hi Ayobami,

Sorry for taking long, was trying to get home.

So in total, so far, we have managed to raise 275,000 Rwf(approximately $275) in cash and 80,000Rwf in pledges.

Since I can’t be sure about the pledges, I would say we have raised $275 out of $1700 hence leaving us with a balance of $ 1425. 
However, our goal is to bring the amount from $1700 to an amount less than $1000 and in case, I would say we still have to raise at least $425 to meet our target.

You can raise any concerns or questions you have.

Thanks to everyone that has contributed and for those that haven’t but would love to, any amount is highly appreciated. 🙏🏻

My humble appeal to us as a community is to lend a hand to our own by giving any amount that you can afford. 

We appreciate you for your generosity and pray that blessings follow you all the days of your life🙏🏾

My humble appeal to us as a community is to lend a hand to our own by giving any amount that you can afford. 

We appreciate you for your generosity and pray that blessings follow you all the days of your life🙏🏾

[13/02/2022, 20:56:11] Esther Namara cmu: Good evening Tartans, one of us is stranded with tuition and the school mandates that the amount is reduced from $1700 to a figure below $1000 by April in order to register for the final semester. My humble appeal to us as a community is to lend a hand to our own by giving any amount that you can afford. 

We appreciate you for your generosity and pray that blessings follow you all the days of your life🙏🏾
Thank you all.

[22/02/2022, 14:15:21] Arisema cmu: Yes.. 🤔
[22/02/2022, 14:15:33] Adebayo EniOluwafe: takes a screenshot*

[22/02/2022, 14:16:31] Adebayo EniOluwafe: But you said it in a very specific context that has been thrown away to fit a narrative
[22/02/2022, 14:17:04] Germann Atakpa cmu: Lol just kidding
[22/02/2022, 14:17:16] Arisema cmu: 🌚
[22/02/2022, 14:17:33] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The context for the screenshot starts at verse 7 and ends at verse 12
[22/02/2022, 14:18:07] Arisema cmu: Thank you knowledgeable ppl, lemme search
[22/02/2022, 14:18:11] Jay Sunday cmu: From verse 9 it was highlighting the importance of partnership. Vs 11 was just an analogy trying to explain the authors point. Well that verse alone sounds funny 😃
[22/02/2022, 14:19:32] Arisema cmu: Wait, aren't verses supposed to be in chapters? 🤔
[22/02/2022, 14:20:19] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The Bible was divided into chapters for ease of reference, not for the flow of ideas.
[22/02/2022, 14:20:41] Arisema cmu: 🧐
[22/02/2022, 14:20:43] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Ecclesiastes is King Solomon's philosophical 'ramblings'

[22/02/2022, 14:23:36] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Your assumption is that wives and concubines apply in the same sense today as they did in that specific time in history
[22/02/2022, 14:24:10] Adebayo EniOluwafe: A quick, cursory look at the context in that historical time shows that it doesn't
[22/02/2022, 14:24:28] Iffanince Hounday cmu: That's the problem of history
[22/02/2022, 14:24:52] ‪+250 785 655 383‬: But Ari it's a fact! 
Isn't it?
[22/02/2022, 14:24:55] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It was recorded that Solomon never fought a war. The only way this could have happened is that he had alliances with people that could have fought with him
[22/02/2022, 14:25:12] Iffanince Hounday cmu: And then? 💀
[22/02/2022, 14:25:16] Adebayo EniOluwafe: And the number way of seeking alliance in that time of history was through marriage
[22/02/2022, 14:25:45] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Number one*
[22/02/2022, 14:25:48] Iffanince Hounday cmu: 💀Oh silly me. Which kind of marriage?
[22/02/2022, 14:25:58] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Maybe it didn't have the same meaning back then
[22/02/2022, 14:26:24] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Yes. Not in the sense that we use it today.

[22/02/2022, 14:26:50] Iffanince Hounday cmu: So to come back to his verse
[22/02/2022, 14:26:54] Iffanince Hounday cmu: What does it mean
[22/02/2022, 14:26:58] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Wife was used for a woman that got married as a virgin while concubine for women that did not.
[22/02/2022, 14:27:17] Iffanince Hounday cmu: 700 wives and 300 concubines
[22/02/2022, 14:27:22] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Today, wife means someone you are legally married to and concubine means side chicks
[22/02/2022, 14:27:51] Jay Sunday cmu: Those things still happen in Northern Nigeria.
[22/02/2022, 14:28:07] Iffanince Hounday cmu: We are getting far from the verse. Let's come back to it
[22/02/2022, 14:28:37] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Yes. It was pretty normal for ancient kings to have a lot of wives and concubines. It was not a function of who they slept with, it was a function of how many kingdoms they made alliances with.
[22/02/2022, 14:28:56] Jay Sunday cmu: 💯
[22/02/2022, 14:29:28] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Historians posit that one of those wives is the Queen of Sheba and we know from history that she didn't live in ancient Israel for an extended period of time because she had her own kingdom to rule.

[22/02/2022, 14:29:55] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Okay but the verse???
[22/02/2022, 14:29:59] Adebayo EniOluwafe: She was technically his wife still
[22/02/2022, 14:30:14] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Anyway, like you said, we have moved from the verse ... Lol
[22/02/2022, 14:30:26] Adebayo EniOluwafe: But a lot of things makes sense when you understand the historical context around them
[22/02/2022, 14:30:54] Iffanince Hounday cmu: If I was looking for a lecture in history I got pretty good docs on the matter
[22/02/2022, 14:30:57] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It is like women today saying men hated them for not letting them go hunting 5,000 years ago.
[22/02/2022, 14:31:11] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Let's discuss it
[22/02/2022, 14:31:32] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Doesn't make any sense today. Makes sense if you put it in it's historical context.
[22/02/2022, 14:31:51] Adebayo EniOluwafe: You wanna discuss an essay from the middle of the essay?
[22/02/2022, 14:31:52] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Okay. Set then! 😂🤣

[22/02/2022, 14:38:51] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Marriage as a function of love is a concept that is barely 200 years old
[22/02/2022, 14:39:12] Adebayo EniOluwafe: @22964812957 You probably should also check the etymology of the phrase sleep tight and how it basically came from the fact that ancient sleep was usually done in cuddles to keep warm during extreme colds
[22/02/2022, 14:39:14] Arisema cmu: Got it. Just meant that alliance was not made through wedding
[22/02/2022, 14:39:20] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Baba calm down and leave this marriage thing 😈
[22/02/2022, 14:40:00] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Yeah but we don't have the "behind the scenes"... Was it just sleeping 💀

[22/02/2022, 14:40:29] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Lol. You have to prove your point really
[22/02/2022, 14:41:03] Adebayo EniOluwafe: There is nothing from the historical context that suggests what you are suggesting
[22/02/2022, 14:41:03] Iffanince Hounday cmu: History is a lie.
What's the proof that sleeping tight is actually just sleeping 😏😏😏
[22/02/2022, 14:41:10] Iffanince Hounday cmu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[22/02/2022, 14:41:18] Kelvin Kamande cmu: 😂😂😂 one text about lying together and suddenly the boys have 200+ messages .... Dammit, however you put it... Laying together in context or out of context .... It's still laying together ..... 


If you study biblical times properly you might end up being the biggest atheist around ... 

I mean them niggas at the time used to marry 12 year olds
[22/02/2022, 14:41:23] Adebayo EniOluwafe: When sex is involved, the word usually used is 'knew'
[22/02/2022, 14:41:44] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Bro, they were 15 year olds
[22/02/2022, 14:41:46] Iffanince Hounday cmu: I know right 💀
[22/02/2022, 14:42:01] Iffanince Hounday cmu: 😂😂Like it's better
[22/02/2022, 14:42:03] Adebayo EniOluwafe: We act like people get married at the same age as we did now
[22/02/2022, 14:42:15] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Point
[22/02/2022, 14:42:20] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Remove your education, what will you have been doing since the age of 13/14
[22/02/2022, 14:42:36] Arisema cmu: Or with the same familial discriminations as now
[22/02/2022, 14:42:37] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Well I guess the notion of pedophilia did evolve through the years

[22/02/2022, 14:43:18] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Of course, it did. Same way everything evolves through the years
[22/02/2022, 14:43:38] Adebayo EniOluwafe: And how does a 15 year old getting married to a 12 years old equate pedophilia
[22/02/2022, 14:43:43] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Even Mary was 14-16 years when she had Jesus
[22/02/2022, 14:44:00] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It is not like people don't date themselves today in high school at those ages
[22/02/2022, 14:44:16] Iffanince Hounday cmu: I guess we will have treated the Holy spirit by all the names if it occured during this time💀
[22/02/2022, 14:44:27] Arisema cmu: This is not pedoohilia even now tho
[22/02/2022, 14:44:41] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The average age of people's first sexual encounter even today is 15 I believe
[22/02/2022, 14:44:59] Iffanince Hounday cmu: A 15year old???
[22/02/2022, 14:45:03] Esther Namara cmu: 🌚

[22/02/2022, 14:49:23] Adebayo EniOluwafe: You are doing the same thing you did before bro. Looks more like you are trying to debate rather than talk. And I hate debates.😂
[22/02/2022, 14:49:53] Adebayo EniOluwafe: This is the root of most of the 'men maltreated women through history

[22/02/2022, 14:51:12] Iffanince Hounday cmu: That's why I wanted to move it inbox💀

[22/02/2022, 14:51:42] Adebayo EniOluwafe: 100 years from now, people will judge all of us for allowing things like plastic waste in the oceans, warming of the planets, etc to happen
[22/02/2022, 14:51:53] Jay Sunday cmu: Just like how animal cruelty is considered a serious offense now .
[22/02/2022, 14:51:53] Arisema cmu: 👌🏼
[22/02/2022, 14:52:03] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Which kind of marriage? 😂The one where people just sleep tight?
[22/02/2022, 14:52:21] Adebayo EniOluwafe: In some time period in the future, you will also qualify as the devil
[22/02/2022, 14:52:41] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Everything is worse in hindsight

[22/02/2022, 15:00:41] Arisema cmu: Yeah.. they are called "minor attracted individuals now"
[22/02/2022, 15:00:54] Adebayo EniOluwafe: By the way, I once had a 6 hour discussion with a friend on why the 'legal age' is 18 and not 8 or 28...
[22/02/2022, 15:01:18] Adebayo EniOluwafe: In the end, we got stuck.. if you have 6 hours on your hands, we can try again 🤗
[22/02/2022, 15:01:19] Iffanince Hounday cmu: In the Bible Joseph married Mary when he was around 40🌝
[22/02/2022, 15:01:34] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Mary was 14-16
[22/02/2022, 15:01:49] Iffanince Hounday cmu: 🌝
[22/02/2022, 15:01:57] Adebayo EniOluwafe: You know why this has to be historically inaccurate? What was Joseph doing with his life between 15 and 40?
[22/02/2022, 15:02:04] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Tonight
[22/02/2022, 15:02:20] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Getting warm alone? 💀🤣
[22/02/2022, 15:02:32] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The whole Da Vinci code was based on the idea that there was no way Jesus would not be married at the age of 30 as a Jew in that time period
[22/02/2022, 15:02:54] Adebayo EniOluwafe: And you think it is reasonable that his father was not married till 40m
[22/02/2022, 15:02:58] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Like DaVinci code is universal truth
[22/02/2022, 15:03:05] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Like, common!
[22/02/2022, 15:03:36] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I am not saying it is truth. I definitely don't believe it is. I am telling you why it got the attention it did.
[22/02/2022, 15:04:06] Iffanince Hounday cmu: 🤣🤣🤣
[22/02/2022, 15:04:26] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Unlike his father, Jesus...
[22/02/2022, 15:04:39] Adebayo EniOluwafe: One of the biggest criticism leveled at the historicity of Jesus is that his life didn't follow a typical young male Jew at that point in history
[22/02/2022, 15:04:42] Iffanince Hounday cmu: That's how imma start my story
[22/02/2022, 15:04:53] Adebayo EniOluwafe: So something must be off in that sense
[22/02/2022, 15:05:23] Iffanince Hounday cmu: The absense of evidence is not the evidenve of absence. Who knows all that happens in secret👀👀👀

[22/02/2022, 15:06:21] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It is why after 2000 years, nobody has been able to conclusively prove or disprove an historical Jesus
[22/02/2022, 15:06:32] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Why are you agreeing. I'm just trying to put some controversial facts so that people get triggered

[22/02/2022, 15:07:43] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Historians agree for certain that a certain version of Jesus must have existed ... What people don't agree on is which version...
[22/02/2022, 15:08:10] Iffanince Hounday cmu: I know 😏
[22/02/2022, 15:08:59] Iffanince Hounday cmu: So are you saying all our faith might be based on nothing? 🤨
[22/02/2022, 15:09:11] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Or the wrong thing ?
[22/02/2022, 15:10:07] Iffanince Hounday cmu: But then, what is wrong what is right

[22/02/2022, 15:11:38] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Just to be clear, there will never be enough evidence to convince you 'for' or 'against' faith
[22/02/2022, 15:12:04] Iffanince Hounday cmu: You don't even know my position

[22/02/2022, 15:12:25] Adebayo EniOluwafe: And that is why it is called faith and not logic. Faith is always based on the element of trust.

[22/02/2022, 15:12:56] Iffanince Hounday cmu: 😂😂
[22/02/2022, 15:13:30] Adebayo EniOluwafe: There is a reason why there a millions of religious sects in the world and only a handful can be proven false
[22/02/2022, 15:14:00] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The biggest religions are the ones who have both an historical and a faith element to them.
[22/02/2022, 15:14:11] Iffanince Hounday cmu: What do you know about deep classical africanity?
[22/02/2022, 15:14:37] Iffanince Hounday cmu: Oh really ? 😳
[22/02/2022, 15:14:39] Adebayo EniOluwafe: So you could make the argument that people are just chosing what version of history to believe. Maybe ... Maybe not. We will all find out one day 🤣
[22/02/2022, 15:15:17] Iffanince Hounday cmu: But actually will we? 😂😂
[22/02/2022, 15:15:58] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Yup 🤗.

There is a reason why three of the biggest religions all claim hold over Jerusalem 😂😂😂 and the fourth one also has an Holy city

[22/02/2022, 17:11:57] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: How this discussion moved from a verse to apologetics 🤯

Anyway @250785673530​, religion is a complex _"construct"_ to understand, a good read would be _Philosophy of Religion: A Very Short Introduction by Tim Bayne_

You can also get an agnostic perspective and response based on the Darwinian theory of natural selection from chapters 5 & 8 of _The God Delusion by R. Dawkins_ this recommendation is because the actual reading -- _Chp 3 of Dawkins Delusion by the McGraths_ that explores _The Origin of Religion_ is a response to Dawkins.
[22/02/2022, 17:20:15] Adebayo EniOluwafe: If you want to read the God Delusion by Dawkins, you probably should also read the Devil Delusion and The Deniable Darwin by David Berlinski. 

The good thing about Berlinski, unlike Dawkins, is that Berlinski is a known agnostic and thus does not share that hatred that Dawkins has for theism nor the love that say Peterson has for theism. 🤗
[22/02/2022, 17:22:03] Adebayo EniOluwafe: By the way, while Dawkins labels himself as an agnostic, almost everyone in the religious apologetics space classify him as an atheist. So, make of that what you may.
[22/02/2022, 17:28:13] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: I sure will check him out. 

Yeah Dawkins hate for religion is outright. But reading through his book I almost retitled the book to _The Darwinian Regilion_
[22/02/2022, 17:28:50] Adebayo EniOluwafe: This is it!!! Bro/Sis 😂😂😂
[22/02/2022, 17:29:01] Adebayo EniOluwafe: This is it!
[22/02/2022, 17:29:09] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: @2348109250377 is like you're on holiday today
[22/02/2022, 17:29:35] Adebayo EniOluwafe: My opinion was that Dawkins was just introducing another religion and rather than use history/revelation to back it, he decided to use evolution
[22/02/2022, 17:30:07] Adebayo EniOluwafe: And since evolution is 'scientific', he feels his religion thrumps other religions since you know, science is never wrong 🤣🤣🤣

The question on _Does our moral sense have a Darwinian origin_ seals it all

My notes on that book though 😅

[22/02/2022, 17:33:59] Adebayo EniOluwafe: This is the same thread that Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris has taken. Harris wrote a whole book called The Moral Landscape, trying to convince himself (I know he didn't convince me 😂) that science can answer ethical questions 🤣🤣🤣
[22/02/2022, 17:34:13] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: Yeah for him empirical evidence overrules the basis of religion. And we see him going back time and again to use Darwinism to make his case, at least for him this theory is more solid

[22/02/2022, 17:34:59] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Same Harris teaches things like mindfulness, meditation, etc and how they help human beings from a scientific standpoint and I am like bro 🤣🤣🤣
[22/02/2022, 17:35:17] Jay Sunday cmu: +10000000
[22/02/2022, 17:35:35] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The problem with basing his entire argument on evolution is that evolution is still not considered a law in science
[22/02/2022, 17:35:42] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: Or have a book club. Missed those things 🤯
[22/02/2022, 17:35:53] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It is a theory that may or may not be disproved in the future
[22/02/2022, 17:36:24] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Basing your entire argument on something that is not conclusive is just shaky at best 😂
[22/02/2022, 17:36:35] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: I haven't read Harris maybe I should. 

Hitchens is another funny guy.
[22/02/2022, 17:37:18] Adebayo EniOluwafe: God! I hate CMU so much. Spent almost two years of my life reading things I didn't like rather than have fun with philosophy 🤣🤣🤣
[22/02/2022, 17:37:49] Adebayo EniOluwafe: 🤣🤣🤣that bro has anger problems. It is like he has a personal beef with God
[22/02/2022, 17:38:32] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The amount of hate Dawkins and Hitchens have towards the idea of God, you cannot but wonder why 😄
[22/02/2022, 17:40:02] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I think Hitchens wrote an essay titled Religion ruins everything. Basically, blaming the idea of God for every bad thing that had happened in human history. I cannot believe someone can hate something they believe does not exist that much. 😅
[22/02/2022, 17:40:08] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: 🤨 why does that sound like a book from somewhere in Japan.
[22/02/2022, 17:40:58] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: Yeah pull that theory and everything crumbles.

[22/02/2022, 17:48:06] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: True he makes some  audacious statements and logical contradictions. 

The chapter he's talking about why there's no God is just a baffling read
[22/02/2022, 17:52:42] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: 😅 false equivalence

[22/02/2022, 17:53:16] ‪+250 791 590 854‬: I like it
[22/02/2022, 17:54:47] Adebayo EniOluwafe: By the way, there is a trilemma in epistemology that 'suggests' that even in the well-defined fields of science and logic, you cannot prove anything to be true. The irony is that we also cannot prove this trilemma to be true 🤣🤣🤣
[22/02/2022, 17:56:57] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It is called the Munchausen Trilemma.

It basically says any proof either has to have circular, regressive, or dogmatic arguments. Simply put, to prove anything, you have to make some assumptions and these assumptions are just that assertions that are taken to be true without proof. 😅
[22/02/2022, 17:59:14] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: Isn't philosophy sweet ... No one is right 😅
[22/02/2022, 17:59:33] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: I know
[22/02/2022, 17:59:37] Adebayo EniOluwafe: P.S: That is the trick to winning every debate ... Just keep chipping at the obvious assumptions. For example, how do you know we are actually alive and not in a simulation works everytime? 🤣🤣🤣
[22/02/2022, 18:00:04] Adebayo EniOluwafe: How do you know God didn't make you an atheist is one I use when I banter with why atheist friends? 🤣🤣🤣
[22/02/2022, 18:00:18] Adebayo EniOluwafe: ~why~ my
[22/02/2022, 18:01:11] Adebayo EniOluwafe: 🤣🤣🤣

In the end, we all know when we know.
[22/02/2022, 18:01:27] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: Me seeing circular referencing everywhere.
[22/02/2022, 18:02:08] Adebayo EniOluwafe: 🤣🤣🤣

Exactly, I have seen an article that actually debates the fact that the trilemma falls a victim of its own hypothesis 😂
[22/02/2022, 18:02:22] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Se we all think we have sense abi 😂😂😂
[22/02/2022, 18:02:24] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: This guy 😅 philosophy in debate you will talk till morning and never agree
[22/02/2022, 18:02:34] Adebayo EniOluwafe: We die here 😂😂😂

[22/02/2022, 18:08:03] Geoffrey Kimani cmu: 😅 let's go back to Ecclesiastes

Hope you are all healthy and safe. I know we’re in the middle of the semester, and stress is piling up but come this Thursday I would like to encourage you all to make some time to attend the Town hall that will be held from 1:30 to 2:30pm in room F205, F305, and A203(as this will be in-person🙂). The town hall presents a great opportunity to express our thoughts as students and gain answers to some of our questions so please do plan to attend.
Thank you!

[24/02/2022, 08:00:49] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Not that Russia has declared a war
[24/02/2022, 08:01:03] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Until, it is unavoidable, they are not going to engage
[24/02/2022, 08:01:14] Adebayo EniOluwafe: And that is because they don't think they can win.
[24/02/2022, 08:01:29] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Can they win? Yes. But are they sure they can? No!!!

[24/02/2022, 08:02:38] Adebayo EniOluwafe: As it stands, Russia has all the aces in this war.
[24/02/2022, 08:02:55] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Once again, you are assuming Russia wants a long-term war
[24/02/2022, 08:03:01] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: That has been Russian Tactics all the way, they fight under shades
[24/02/2022, 08:03:26] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The only reason nobody uses nuclear weapons in a war is because it will definitely wipe almost everyone 😂
[24/02/2022, 08:03:44] Adebayo EniOluwafe: So it is like we both have a gun knowing that we can both shoot but we don't want to
[24/02/2022, 08:04:20] Adebayo EniOluwafe: But the moment I feel I have nothing to lose, I will shoot and I know you will shoot back but the key is that we will both die
[24/02/2022, 08:04:24] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Their intention is to control Ukraine, but the people don't want that

I'd like for someone to raise this issue for me and I'd really appreciate it if I can get feedback. 

The cafeteria folks have repeatedly ignored/refused to react to my query for them to always wear their nose-masks when dealing with food or standing atop the buffet setup. It's annoying when they constantly "spit" into the "food area" as they respond to people's questions or enquires. 

Can the school admin bring them to order? We cannot have to wear nose masks all day only for them to get away with this because it's the "cafeteria" and casually pour rain near the food setup. 

Any kind soul to help with this.

My humble appeal to us as a community is to lend a hand to our own by giving any amount that you can afford. 

We appreciate you for your generosity and pray that blessings follow you all the days of your life🙏🏾
Thank you all.

When I obtained my Masters and PhD degrees, I sent out over 300 job applications but couldn't get a job. I was two times Finalist of the *Heineken International Graduate Program* (10 finalist selected from over 30,000 applicants after 7 recruitment stages)  but still couldn't succeed at the interview.

After starting my own company and working with over 50 top executives in different companies globally, I discovered the *one thing that recruiters actually want in Masters/PhD level candidates*.

I passed through a lot of pain before and after the surgery but after all I am thankful that I am alive and able to do little things waiting to get better for bigger ones. Actually, I had a left arm dislocation issue due to the fact that I had a shoulder injury back in the days of the year 2018 when I was trying to get off the hole where I and my friends were digging to make bricks for helping someone to find a place to stay. It's not football or any other sports that I got the injury from. If I can tell, I would like to thank the people who prayed for my well being and especially to those who even managed to visit me at the hospital and home as well. Though I still have to go a long way to get fine as I should, I am sure that you guys are with me in all. God bless CMU people especially you tartans ❤️.

[02/03/2022, 21:55:37] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: Justifiable???
Interesting you will say that when that resulted in more deaths than the actual crime. 
Unless you are blond with blue eyes, your doesn’t matter so much
[02/03/2022, 21:55:41] Courage Ekoh CMU: America has the Midas touch

[02/03/2022, 21:56:30] Adebayo EniOluwafe: You are valuing your western allegiance over human lives. Great!
[02/03/2022, 21:56:50] G William Kasaazi cmu: People have time in this school.

[02/03/2022, 21:57:20] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: I am not, I am just comparing Russian invasion and the one in Afghanistan
[02/03/2022, 21:57:45] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: One was provoked, the other was not
[02/03/2022, 21:57:49] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The Afghanistan invasion is far worse than the Russian ones currently is
[02/03/2022, 21:57:55] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: Why are you in school bro? 
I believe to add value to society is included. Thus, knowing the society also matters
[02/03/2022, 21:58:00] Adebayo EniOluwafe: How was Afghanistan provoked?
[02/03/2022, 21:58:06] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Like how?
[02/03/2022, 21:58:18] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Is Al-Qaeda Afghanistan?
[02/03/2022, 21:58:18] G William Kasaazi cmu: Come again

[02/03/2022, 21:58:36] G William Kasaazi cmu: Yes
[02/03/2022, 21:58:39] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: Russia is doing today what America has been doing for years
[02/03/2022, 21:58:50] G William Kasaazi cmu: Yes
[02/03/2022, 21:59:57] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: And forget what the media is portraying. This goes beyond what is happening today. There are historical reasons why Russia “needs” to result to this
[02/03/2022, 22:02:06] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Anyways, I detest wars, I am not making excuses for any war, I know the US has a terrible history, but in this case, they are way better that what Putin is doing, even to his people, don't even compare that. unless u just wanna like dictators
[02/03/2022, 22:02:43] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: All is fair in love and war bro
[02/03/2022, 22:03:41] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: Don’t support wars either but it is sometimes necessary. The world didn’t become like this true peace. America itself is mighty mainly because of war.
[02/03/2022, 22:04:28] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: No vex o, snr man, no joke we dey joke😀
[02/03/2022, 22:05:21] ‪+250 785 655 383‬: What about native americans?

[02/03/2022, 22:06:46] ‪+250 785 655 383‬: Was*
[02/03/2022, 22:07:44] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: Bro
You are going too far into the past. Let’s limit the discussion from the last century to this one please
[02/03/2022, 22:08:01] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: If America should have invaded Canada, and said they are one people long ago
[02/03/2022, 22:10:13] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: Context is everything and examples are a cheap means of making an argument but I’ll indulge you.

Using your scenario, imagine Canada becomes partners with China and decide to form a military alliance. Do you think America will take that lightly
[02/03/2022, 22:14:50] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: So u are saying Ukraine has no right to be independent?They decided to be democratic, to elect their leaders, u invaded their land and started a war for 8 years, a nuclear power, and u feel they are not threatened to seek protection? All these small countries joining NATO, is bcos they are threathened by Russia
[02/03/2022, 22:16:52] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: Same could have been said about Cuba when they tried to form a military alliance with Russia. America opposed it militarily. Cuba is still suffering from sanctions from that time
[02/03/2022, 22:17:09] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: And Cuba was an independent country
[02/03/2022, 22:18:25] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Sanctions is different from invasion, Russia just invades
[02/03/2022, 22:19:42] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: The US is still keeping Guantánamo Bay but oh no? that’s not an invasion
[02/03/2022, 22:20:11] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: I guess the words also have different meanings when it comes to some countries
[02/03/2022, 22:20:39] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: Clearly you don’t know about this but I’ll move it along
[02/03/2022, 22:20:43] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Was that from an invasion?
[02/03/2022, 22:23:13] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: If another country decides to setup a military base in your country without your permission and refuses to leave. Can I say that’s an invasion?
[02/03/2022, 22:26:37] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Hmm, u are adding too many twists, they had some lease arrangement before, but it was seized.
[02/03/2022, 22:29:59] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: No please
[02/03/2022, 22:30:23] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It is twist not invasion bro 😂

[02/03/2022, 22:37:05] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Even the most ardent of Western supporters I have met don't justify Afghanistan
[02/03/2022, 22:37:19] Adebayo EniOluwafe: You can justify anything but not Afghanistan
[02/03/2022, 22:37:32] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It was an unnecessary disaster
[02/03/2022, 22:37:46] Courage Ekoh CMU: @2348033908529 do you realize that America terrorised the peace of Afghanistan for 20 years? 20 years!
[02/03/2022, 22:38:23] Adebayo EniOluwafe: @2348033908529 is the first person I have met that justified Afghanistan bro
[02/03/2022, 22:38:30] Adebayo EniOluwafe: It is unbelievable 😂😂😂
[02/03/2022, 22:38:55] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: @2348109250377 , stop thinking about the past, based on the current situation are u supportin Russia or the west?
[02/03/2022, 22:39:03] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: @2348033908529 maybe you have to do a bit more research and come again
[02/03/2022, 22:39:18] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Yeah because it is binary 😆
[02/03/2022, 22:39:38] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I am against the war. I have made that so clear.
[02/03/2022, 22:39:50] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: See wayo man😀
[02/03/2022, 22:40:07] Adebayo EniOluwafe: And there was a clear path to avoid it but the West was too arrogant to allow it
[02/03/2022, 22:40:26] Adebayo EniOluwafe: How hard is it to say ok, no NATO in Ukraine

[02/03/2022, 22:41:12] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Do u know the conditions putin gave them?
[02/03/2022, 22:41:15] Courage Ekoh CMU: @2348033908529 if he was a reporter
[02/03/2022, 22:41:33] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Why are you prioritizing your ambitions over the lives of people?
[02/03/2022, 22:42:02] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Did anyone ask the Ukrainian people if they wanted NATO at the cost of lives and peace?
[02/03/2022, 22:42:34] Adebayo EniOluwafe: About a million refugees already. Millions have their lives turned upside down.
[02/03/2022, 22:42:35] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: U talk as if Ukrain is just a pawn on the chess board,they have no say
[02/03/2022, 22:42:49] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: Basically that’s all it is

[02/03/2022, 22:43:29] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: America doesn’t care about them. Only their interest. They always say it. It’s not even a secret
[02/03/2022, 22:43:42] Adebayo EniOluwafe: If Russia was so bothered about democracy and reuniting the USSR, why have they left Azerbaijan, Estonia and Lithuania untouched?
[02/03/2022, 22:44:03] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Ukraine is the second biggest country in Europe
[02/03/2022, 22:44:30] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: They have puppets there already

[02/03/2022, 22:51:27] Adebayo EniOluwafe: If I was the Ukrainian president, I wouldn't have taken any anti-Russian, pro-West position
[02/03/2022, 22:52:02] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Azerbaijan, at the very least, have shown that Russia doesn't care about you as long as you stay neutral
[02/03/2022, 22:52:02] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: Neutral is always great

[02/03/2022, 22:52:29] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: The guy has said he doesn't want NATO again but he wants EU

[02/03/2022, 22:53:05] Adebayo EniOluwafe: This is a good compromise if this is true
[02/03/2022, 22:53:24] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Just stay neutral on military related stuffs
[02/03/2022, 22:53:31] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Bruv, problem is u didnt research to know what happened in the past,
[02/03/2022, 22:53:43] Adebayo EniOluwafe: If Russia and US have beef, let them fight in Alaska
[02/03/2022, 22:53:52] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Or Greenland 😂
[02/03/2022, 22:54:32] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Don't let them use your own people and land as the site to settle their beef
[02/03/2022, 22:54:41] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Ukraine had nuclear weapons before, they signed a pact to give it up and Russia signed never to attack them,
[02/03/2022, 22:55:40] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: So bcos the proRussian govt was toppled by the people, tou attack them
[02/03/2022, 22:56:07] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Is that fair?
[02/03/2022, 22:56:13] Adebayo EniOluwafe: This is the mistake you are making. This war is just happening on Ukrainian soil. It is not a Ukrainian war.
[02/03/2022, 22:57:00] Adebayo EniOluwafe: The Ukrainian people are just the expendables that the West have decided to use.
[02/03/2022, 22:57:42] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Why have British and American soldiers die and have people remind you of Afghanistan when you can use Ukrainian soldiers instead?
[02/03/2022, 22:59:02] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Shebi the president is getting standing ovation for bravery? 😂
[02/03/2022, 22:59:10] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Ok, I agree, you have to pitch that to the world, bcos Russia is now a Pariah state😀

[02/03/2022, 22:59:57] Adebayo EniOluwafe: As a world, we are good at standing with people
[02/03/2022, 23:00:28] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I don't think the Ukrainian people wanted this anyway
[02/03/2022, 23:00:41] Adebayo EniOluwafe: And it could have be avoided with a simple - We are staying neutral
[02/03/2022, 23:01:45] ‪+233 55 008 0890‬: And you did?
The relationship between Ukraine and Russia his very historical. The Russian empire started from Ukraine. Ukraine joining NATO will be the last battle of the Cold War for Russia and they don’t want another defeat
[02/03/2022, 23:01:45] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: At the expense of their future? Are Russians free today?
[02/03/2022, 23:02:14] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Like Nigeria is free 😂
[02/03/2022, 23:02:26] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Se we want to be going that route
[02/03/2022, 23:02:31] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: I am sure u are happy with that
[02/03/2022, 23:02:45] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Wait, you believe Nigeria is a democracy
[02/03/2022, 23:02:50] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Ha!
[02/03/2022, 23:02:59] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: I dont
[02/03/2022, 23:03:05] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Buhari? A democrat? 😂😂
[02/03/2022, 23:03:29] Adebayo EniOluwafe: So why are you worrying about Russia 😆😆😆
[02/03/2022, 23:04:18] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Because, the more countries are free, the more I am likely to be free😀
[02/03/2022, 23:04:51] Adebayo EniOluwafe: There have been three coups in West Africa in the past 1 year bro
[02/03/2022, 23:05:00] Adebayo EniOluwafe: And people celebrated
[02/03/2022, 23:05:51] Adebayo EniOluwafe: So maybe we need to ask people what they want rather than if they are  Western ideologues (case in point - Rwanda)
[02/03/2022, 23:09:38] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Ok, I see where u are coming from. But that's not what Ukraine want, lets see how Putin can successfully force them
[02/03/2022, 23:10:04] Jay Sunday cmu: The resolve 😃
[02/03/2022, 23:10:36] Adebayo EniOluwafe: But do they want a war?
[02/03/2022, 23:10:46] Adebayo EniOluwafe: I cannot remember anyone asking this question
[02/03/2022, 23:12:33] Adebayo EniOluwafe: Saying they are brave for fighting for their survival and not asking if they wanted to be in the position to need to fight for their survival is interesting to say the least.
[02/03/2022, 23:13:19] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Only oppressors like Putin looks for wars, but when invaded,what else can dey do?

[03/03/2022, 20:25:58] Esther Namara cmu: Hello Tartans,

I’d like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your prayers, support and everything you did in moving this project.

I’m happy to tell you that this project has even exceeded its intended/desired target by collecting $1750 out of $1700.

May God bless you all for these generous hearts and double your desires.😍😍😍😍

I’m so delighted to have started and now closing this project.

Yaaaay Tartans ❤️❤️❤️.

[03/03/2022, 20:32:22] Esther Namara cmu: Good evening Tartans, one of us is stranded with tuition and the school mandates that the amount is reduced from $1700 to a figure below $1000 by April in order to register for the final semester. My humble appeal to us as a community is to lend a hand to our own by giving any amount that you can afford. 

We appreciate you for your generosity and pray that blessings follow you all the days of your life🙏🏾
Thank you all.

[04/03/2022, 02:06:52] ‪+251 92 669 1945‬: The Battle of Adwa⚔ was the climactic battle of the First 🇮🇹 vs 🇪🇹 War. The Ethiopian forces defeated the Italian invading force on Sunday 1 March 1896, near the town of Adwa. The decisive victory thwarted the campaign of the Kingdom of Italy to expand its colonial empire in the Horn of Africa. By the end of the 19th century, European powers had carved up almost all of Africa after the Berlin Conference; only Ethiopia🇪🇹 and Liberia🇱🇷 still maintained their independence. Adwa became a pre-eminent symbol of pan-Africanism and secured Ethiopian sovereignty.

On March 1, we Ethiopian celebrate Victory day⚔

Incase it's in the wisdom of government of Rwanda not to renew the agreement, I go home and attend the rest of the remaining semesters online from Pittsburghs and the degree will still come from Pittsburghs.

For instance, if the agreement was 10 years from 2012-2022 subject to conformity of CMU to government defined policies and Standards,then the government will also make the public aware of the renewal.


I wonder why 2023 class can be worried if for instance the agreement goes for more 10 years from 2022-2032

Your worry should be maintaining 3.0QPA which I am sure  all of us are adhering to such terms.

[06/03/2022, 13:15:24] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Dear Fellow Nigerians,

The High Commission wishes to inform that a team from the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) will be arriving Kigali on 10th March 2022 for the earlier announced passport intervention exercise. All affected members of the Nigerian community in Rwanda are urged to turn up at the High Commission for capturing.

Date: 11th - 16th March 2022

Time: 11am - 2pm

Passport renewal fee: 150$ (This includes Administrative charges)

Eligibility: 
1. Nigerians with expired passport
2. Anyone whose passport expires in the next 12 months (1year).
3. Those with loss passport (police report must be attached), and
4. Applicants in need of new passport (especially new born babies)

Note: 

As the good people of Nigeria in Rwanda may be aware, the Mission does not currently have immigration outpost in kigali which makes it quite challenging for Nigerian residents in Rwanda to renew their passport as at when due. This therefore informs the inclusion of those whose passport is still valid for the next 12 months. The aim is to  proactively avert future delay in the renewal of those passports when they would have been due next year. 

In the light of this, concerned Nigerians in this category are urged to take advantage of this very exercise.

The Mission however, wishes to state that there is no law barring a passport that is still valid for 12 months from being renewed.

Members of the Association of Nigerians in Rwanda (ANR) are requested to disseminate this important information to all concerned Nigerians. 

Nigeria High Commission, Kigali.

[06/03/2022, 13:37:28] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Hello Tartans,



Today, the 6th of March 2022, we join with our fellow Tartans from the Gold Coast to celebrate their 65th independence and Ghana National Day. The celebrations commemorate Ghana’s independence from the United Kingdom in 1957 under the leadership of Osagyefo Dr Kwame Nkrumah. Ghana became the first African country south of the Sahara to gain independence from colonial rule, inspiring other African countries to declare independence. The name “Ghana” originates from an ancient African empire that was once famous for its significant power, land, and wealth. Ghana means ‘strong warrior’ or ‘war chief’.

There are six major ethnic groups in Ghana - the Akan, Ewe, Ga-Adangbe, Mole-Dagbani, Guan, and Gurma. The largest tribe are the Ashanti, with their traditional capital at Kumasi. Ghanaian food mixes indigenous flavours and outside influences - like European and Indian.  Fufu is made from starch, including cassava, plantain, yam, potatoes or cocoyams. Another Ghanaian cuisine is jollof rice, a one-pot rice dish that includes a variety of Ghanaian spices with tomatoes and chilli.

Tartan’s join to celebrate with you, as carnivals and parades are held across Ghana today, from the capital, Accra, on the scenic coastline of the Gulf of Guinea, to the northern heritage-rich city of Tamale.

Afehyia Pa, Kwaku Ghana! 🍷🎺

[07/03/2022, 11:19:07] ‪+234 803 390 8529‬: Dear Fellow Nigerians,

The High Commission wishes to inform that a team from the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) will be arriving Kigali on 10th March 2022 for the earlier announced passport intervention exercise. All affected members of the Nigerian community in Rwanda are urged to turn up at the High Commission for capturing.

Date: 11th - 16th March 2022

Time: 11am - 2pm

Passport renewal fee: 150$ (This includes Administrative charges)

Eligibility: 
1. Nigerians with expired passport
2. Anyone whose passport expires in the next 12 months (1year).
3. Those with loss passport (police report must be attached), and
4. Applicants in need of new passport (especially new born babies)

Note: 

As the good people of Nigeria in Rwanda may be aware, the Mission does not currently have immigration outpost in kigali which makes it quite challenging for Nigerian residents in Rwanda to renew their passport as at when due. This therefore informs the inclusion of those whose passport is still valid for the next 12 months. The aim is to  proactively avert future delay in the renewal of those passports when they would have been due next year. 

In the light of this, concerned Nigerians in this category are urged to take advantage of this very exercise.

The Mission however, wishes to state that there is no law barring a passport that is still valid for 12 months from being renewed.

Members of the Association of Nigerians in Rwanda (ANR) are requested to disseminate this important information to all concerned Nigerians. 

Nigeria High Commission, Kigali.

===================
Heey yall!  
Attention is being drawn to those using the student lounge.

Some house keeping rules:

1. Please wash the cups and spoons you've used when having your tea or coffee.

2. Leave the counter clean and tidy after use.

3. The school only provides coffee, tea and sugar, any other item in the student lounge is not school provided, so DO NOT use or take whatever doesn't belong to you. It is impolite to use unauthorized things. 

For the students who've been asking, do note that the school does not provide more than what has been mentioned above.

Murakoze.

I hope you are still surviving 🤗.

I pass by to remind you that we are currently receiving contributions to the student fund for January and February 2022.The contribution is 5000 Rwf per month.

This student fund helps some of our colleagues who could be struggling to make ends meet. Also, since we are currently accessing campus; we shall be using part of these funds to celebrate our babies for each month.

Contributions are shared through Momo account 0790903291 registered on Alice Niwemutoni Gatera. Your contribution will help a fellow student in need and enable us to celebrate with you on your birthday.

 

Cheers.
